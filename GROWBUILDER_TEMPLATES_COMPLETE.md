        "overlayColor": "black",
        "overlayOpacity": 40

  ]
}
```

### Pages Structure

Each page is stored in the `site_template_pages` table with:
- `site_template_id` - Links to parent template
- `title` - Page title
- `slug` - URL slug
- `content` - JSON containing sections array
- `is_homepage` - Boolean flag
- `show_in_nav` - Boolean flag
- `sort_order` - Display order

### Hero Slider Configuration

The home page hero section uses a slideshow layout with:
- **Section Type**: `hero-slider` (recognized by Site.vue preview component)
- **Layout**: `slideshow`
- **Autoplay**: Enabled with 5-second intervals (`autoplay: true`, `interval: 5000`)
- **4 Slides**: 
  1. Main slide - 2H Creative Studio overview
  2. Graphic Design Excellence
  3. Professional Photography
  4. Quality Printing Services
- **Overlay**: 40% black overlay for text readability (`overlayColor: 'black'`, `overlayOpacity: 40`)
- **Images**: High-quality Unsplash images for each slide

### Frontend Component

**File:** `resources/js/pages/GrowBuilder/Preview/Site.vue`

The preview component supports:
- `layout: 'slideshow'` for hero sections
- `autoPlay` property (capital P)
- `slideInterval` property (in milliseconds)
- Background images on slides
- Automatic overlay application

### Running the Seeder

**For all templates (recommended for production):**
```bash
php artisan db:seed --class=MasterSiteTemplatesSeeder
```

This will:
- Clear existing templates (site_templates, site_template_pages, site_template_industries)
- Seed all 29 working templates including DH Creative Studio
- Takes approximately 15 seconds to complete

**For DH Creative only:**
```bash
php artisan db:seed --class=DHCreativeStudioSeeder
```

Note: Running individual seeders won't clear existing templates.

### Verification

After seeding, verify the template:
1. Check database: Template should exist in `site_templates` table (ID: 180) with 3 pages in `site_template_pages`
2. Go to GrowBuilder > Create New Site
3. Look for "2H Creative Studio" in the template selection
4. Click "Preview" button to see the template
5. Home page should show auto-playing slider with 4 slides
6. Services page should show all service categories
7. Contact page should have contact form and information

### Accessing the Template

**In the App:**
1. Navigate to GrowBuilder section
2. Click "Create New Site"
3. Scroll to "Choose a Template" section
4. Find "2H Creative Studio" card (industry: creative)
5. Click "Preview" to see it in action
6. Click "Select" to use it for your new site

### Template Details:**
- Name: 2H Creative Studio
- Tagline: At Your Service For The Best
- Industry: Creative & Photography
- Pages: 4 (Home, Services, Contact, **Tiyamike Band**)
- Sections: 10 on home page (hero slideshow, about, Tiyamike hero, band services, 4 creative service sections, gallery, CTA)

## Color Scheme

- **Primary**: #1e3a8a (Navy Blue)
- **Secondary**: #1e40af (Lighter Blue)

## Troubleshooting

### Missing Sections in Template Preview

**Problem**: Premium templates showing only headers, other sections not displaying.

**Root Cause**: Site.vue preview component was missing essential section types used by premium templates.

**Solution**: Added all missing section types to Site.vue:
- `stats` - Statistics/metrics display
- `page-header` - Page headers with background colors
- `features` - Feature grids with icons
- `services` - Service listings
- `pricing` - Pricing tables
- `contact` - Contact forms and info
- `team` - Team member profiles
- `map` - Location maps
- `cta` - Call-to-action sections
- `faq` - FAQ sections with collapsible items
- `gallery` - Image galleries
- `products` - Product listings

**Result**: All templates (basic and premium) now use the same unified Site.vue implementation and display all sections correctly.

### Double Hero Sections

**Problem**: Pages showing two hero sections.

**Cause**: This was not an actual issue - templates correctly use `hero` for home pages and `page-header` for other pages. They are different section types with different styling.

**Note**: If you see what appears to be double headers, check if one is a `hero` and one is a `page-header` - this is intentional design.

- Built frontend assets with slider functionality
- Fixed: Template now seeds into correct table (`site_templates` instead of `growbuilder_templates`)
- Created proper seeder: `DHCreativeSiteTemplateSeeder.php`
- Template now appears in GrowBuilder site creation wizard
