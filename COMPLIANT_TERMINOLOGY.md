## What is "Community Rewards"?

### Business Model (Compliant Explanation)

**MyGrowNet operates empowerment projects:**
- Agricultural ventures
- Manufacturing businesses
- Service companies
- Community enterprises

**When these projects succeed:**
- Company shares success with active members
- Distributed quarterly as "Community Rewards"
- Reward for being an active, engaged member
- NOT investment returns (members don't invest in projects)

**Key Distinction:**
- Members subscribe to MyGrowNet platform
- Company invests in projects (not members)
- Company shares success as membership benefit
- This is a reward program, not investment returns

---

## Communication Guidelines

### ✅ DO SAY:

- "Earn commissions by referring members"
- "Receive community rewards as an active member"
- "Quarterly member benefits from company success"
- "Loyalty rewards for engagement"
- "Membership earnings"
- "Team performance bonuses"

### ❌ DON'T SAY:

- "Invest in MyGrowNet"
- "Get returns on your investment"
- "Profit sharing from investments"
- "Dividend payments"
- "ROI of X%"
- "Investment portfolio"

---

## Legal Compliance

### Why This Matters

**Zambian Law:**
- Investment schemes require special licensing
- Pyramid schemes are illegal
- Must clearly distinguish from investment products

**MyGrowNet Compliance:**
- ✅ Subscription-based service
- ✅ Members pay for products/services
- ✅ Commissions from product sales
- ✅ Rewards are membership benefits
- ✅ NOT investment returns

---

## Database vs Display

### Database (Technical)
```php
// Table: profit_shares
// Column: amount
// Status: paid/pending
```
**Internal name:** Can stay as "profit_shares" (technical)

### Display (User-Facing)
```
Label: "Community Rewards"
Description: "Quarterly member benefits"
```
**User-facing:** Must use compliant terminology

---

- [x] Update description to "Quarterly member benefits"
