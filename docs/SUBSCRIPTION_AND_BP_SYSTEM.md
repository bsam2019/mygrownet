## 3. Bonus Points (BP) System

### What are Bonus Points?

BP are monthly performance points that determine your share of the **60% profit pool** distributed to members.

### BP Earning Activities (Admin Configurable)

| Activity | Default BP | Admin Can Adjust |
|----------|-----------|------------------|
| New Member Registration | 100 BP | ✅ |
| Direct Referral (Level 1) | 50 BP | ✅ |
| Indirect Referral (Level 2-7) | 20 BP | ✅ |
| Monthly Renewal | 30 BP | ✅ |
| Course Completion | 25 BP | ✅ |
| Workshop Attendance | 15 BP | ✅ |
| Product Purchase (per K100) | 10 BP | ✅ |
| Downline Activation | 20 BP | ✅ |

### BP Conversion Rate (Admin Configurable)

**Default**: 1 BP = K0.50

Admin can:
- Set new conversion rates
- View rate history
- Set effective dates
- Add notes for changes

### Monthly BP Distribution Formula

```
Your Monthly Bonus = (Your BP / Total Platform BP) × 60% of Monthly Profit
```

**Example:**
- Platform monthly profit: K100,000
- 60% to members: K60,000
- Your BP: 500
- Total platform BP: 10,000
- Your share: (500/10,000) × K60,000 = K3,000

## 5. Income Calculation Examples

### Example 1: Associate Member (K100/month)

**Network**: 3 direct referrals

**Monthly Subscription Commissions:**
- Level 1: 3 × (K100 × 15%) = K45

**BP Earnings:**
- 3 registrations: 3 × 100 BP = 300 BP
- 3 direct referrals: 3 × 50 BP = 150 BP
- Monthly renewal: 30 BP
- **Total**: 480 BP

**BP Bonus** (if platform profit = K100k):
- (480 / 10,000) × K60,000 = K2,880

**Total Monthly Income**: K45 + K2,880 = **K2,925**

---

### Example 2: Professional Member (K150/month)

**Network**: 12 members (3 direct + 9 level 2)

**Monthly Subscription Commissions:**
- Level 1: 3 × (K150 × 15%) = K67.50
- Level 2: 9 × (K150 × 10%) = K135
- **Total**: K202.50

**BP Earnings:**
- 12 registrations: 12 × 100 BP = 1,200 BP
- 3 direct referrals: 3 × 50 BP = 150 BP
- 9 indirect referrals: 9 × 20 BP = 180 BP
- Monthly renewal: 30 BP
- 2 courses completed: 2 × 25 BP = 50 BP
- **Total**: 1,610 BP

**BP Bonus**:
- (1,610 / 10,000) × K60,000 = K9,660

**Total Monthly Income**: K202.50 + K9,660 = **K9,862.50**

---

### Example 3: Ambassador Member (K600/month)

**Network**: 3,279 members (full 7-level matrix)

**Monthly Subscription Commissions:**
- Level 1: 3 × (K600 × 15%) = K270
- Level 2: 9 × (K600 × 10%) = K540
- Level 3: 27 × (K600 × 8%) = K1,296
- Level 4: 81 × (K600 × 6%) = K2,916
- Level 5: 243 × (K600 × 4%) = K5,832
- Level 6: 729 × (K600 × 3%) = K13,122
- Level 7: 2,187 × (K600 × 2%) = K26,244
- **Total**: K50,220

**BP Earnings:**
- 3,279 registrations: 3,279 × 100 BP = 327,900 BP
- Network referrals: ~10,000 BP
- Monthly activities: ~500 BP
- **Total**: ~338,400 BP

**BP Bonus** (if platform profit = K1M):
- (338,400 / 1,000,000) × K600,000 = K203,040

**Total Monthly Income**: K50,220 + K203,040 = **K253,260**
