## Image Best Practices

### 1. Background

**✅ DO:**
- Use white or light neutral backgrounds
- Ensure consistent background across all images
- Remove clutter and distractions
- Use plain surfaces or backdrops

**❌ DON'T:**
- Use busy or patterned backgrounds
- Include unrelated objects
- Use dark backgrounds (unless product requires it)
- Mix different background styles

### 2. Lighting

**✅ DO:**
- Use natural daylight when possible
- Ensure even lighting across the product
- Avoid harsh shadows
- Use diffused light for soft shadows

**❌ DON'T:**
- Use direct flash (creates harsh shadows)
- Shoot in dim lighting
- Mix different light sources (warm + cool)
- Create overexposed or underexposed images

### 3. Angles & Composition

**✅ DO:**
- Show product from multiple angles (front, back, sides, top)
- Include close-ups of important details
- Show product in use (lifestyle shots)
- Demonstrate scale with common objects
- Center the product in frame

**❌ DON'T:**
- Use only one angle
- Crop important parts of the product
- Use extreme angles that distort the product
- Leave too much empty space

### 4. Image Quality

**✅ DO:**
- Use high-resolution images (minimum 1200x1200px)
- Ensure images are sharp and in focus
- Show true colors of the product
- Keep images clean and professional

**❌ DON'T:**
- Upload blurry or pixelated images
- Over-edit or heavily filter images
- Misrepresent product colors
- Use watermarks (system adds them if needed)

### 5. Image Order

**First Image (Primary):**
- Main product shot on white background
- Full product visible
- Best angle showing key features
- This appears in search results and thumbnails

**Additional Images:**
- Different angles (back, sides, top)
- Close-ups of details (texture, materials, labels)
