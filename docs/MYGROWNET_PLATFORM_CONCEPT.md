## 1. Overview

MyGrowNet is a modern **community empowerment and growth platform** designed to equip members with practical life skills, mentorship, and income opportunities. It combines digital learning, personal development, and structured rewards through a sustainable 7-level community model.

### Legal Structure

The platform is built as a **Private Limited Company**, not a collective investment scheme, ensuring full legal compliance. Members do not invest in pooled funds; instead, they subscribe for access to products, learning packs, and mentorship programs while benefiting from structured bonuses and community incentives.

### Mission

MyGrowNet's mission is to create a community of empowered individuals who grow together through skills, entrepreneurship, and shared rewards.

---

## 2. Core Value Proposition

MyGrowNet helps individuals grow personally and financially through three key pillars:

### ðŸŽ“ Learn
Access skill-based training, coaching, and life improvement resources.

### ðŸ’° Earn
Build income through referrals, mentorship incentives, and level bonuses.

### ðŸš€ Grow
Receive milestone rewards, booster funds, and support for business projects.

This approach promotes **long-term empowerment** and avoids dependency on donations or high-risk investments.

### e. Empowerment Projects with Profit-Sharing

MyGrowNet invests in or partners with small community projectsâ€”such as:
- Agriculture
- Manufacturing
- Services
- Real estate development
- Technology ventures

**Profit-Sharing Model:**

These ventures generate returns that are shared with all active members:

**Distribution Structure:**
- **60% of project profits** distributed to active members quarterly
- **40%** retained for company operations, growth, and reserves

**Member Distribution (Quarterly):**
- **50% equal share** - Divided equally among all active members
- **50% weighted share** - Distributed proportionally based on professional level

**Active Member Criteria:**
- Current subscription paid
- Logged in within last 30 days
- Participating in platform activities

**Example:** If empowerment projects generate K100,000 in quarterly profits:
- K60,000 goes to members
- K30,000 distributed equally (if 1,000 active members = K30 each)
- K30,000 distributed by level (Ambassadors receive higher share than Associates)

This creates a **fifth income stream** for members beyond commissions, bonuses, and booster funds.
