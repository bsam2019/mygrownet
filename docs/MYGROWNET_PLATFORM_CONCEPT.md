**Date**: October 20, 2025  
**Status**: LP/BP System Integration

---

## 1. Overview

MyGrowNet is a modern **digital wealth and empowerment platform** that combines investments, e-commerce, learning, and a referral-based income model within a compliant limited liability company structure. Members earn monthly income through **participation**, **learning**, **purchasing**, and **network growth**.

The platform is powered by a revolutionary **dual-point reward system**:
- **Life Points (LP)** - Track long-term growth and professional advancement
- **Bonus Points (BP)** - Calculate monthly earnings and profit-sharing

### Legal Structure

The platform is built as a **Private Limited Company**, not a collective investment scheme, ensuring full legal compliance. Members do not invest in pooled funds; instead, they subscribe for access to products, learning packs, and mentorship programs while benefiting from structured bonuses and community incentives.

### Mission

MyGrowNet's mission is to create a community of empowered individuals who grow together through skills, entrepreneurship, and shared rewards â€” measured and rewarded through transparent, performance-based point systems.
