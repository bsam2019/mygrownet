# Roles System Update - Complete

## Overview

Successfully updated the roles system to align with MyGrowNet platform documentation.

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**

---

## What Was Changed

### 1. ✅ Added "Member" Role

**New Role**: `member`
- Replaces "investor" terminology
- Aligns with subscription-based platform model
- Primary role for regular platform users

**Permissions**:
- `view_member_dashboard`
- `create_subscription`
- `cancel_subscription`
- `view_personal_reports`
- `view_personal_matrix`
- `view_personal_commissions`
- `view_personal_points`

### 2. ✅ Updated Permissions

**New Subscription-Based Permissions**:
- `manage_subscriptions`
- `view_team_subscriptions`
- `create_subscription`
- `cancel_subscription`

**New Content Management Permissions**:
- `manage_courses`
- `manage_learning_packs`
- `manage_community_projects`

**New Points Management Permissions**:
- `manage_points`
- `award_points`
- `view_team_points`
- `view_personal_points`

**New Member Management Permissions**:
- `manage_members`
- `view_team_members`

### 3. ✅ Maintained Backward Compatibility

**Legacy Roles Kept**:
- `investor` - Marked as legacy, redirects to member functionality
- `manager` - Marked as legacy

**Why**: To avoid breaking existing user assignments

## Role Structure

### System Roles (Access Control)

| Role | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| **admin** | Platform administrators | ✅ Active |
| **member** | Regular platform users | ✅ Active (NEW) |
| **investor** | Legacy role | ⚠️ Deprecated |
| **manager** | Legacy role | ⚠️ Deprecated |

### Professional Levels (Progression)

**Note**: These are NOT roles, they are progression levels stored in `users.professional_level`:

1. Associate (Level 1)
2. Professional (Level 2)
3. Senior (Level 3)
4. Manager (Level 4)
5. Director (Level 5)
6. Executive (Level 6)
7. Ambassador (Level 7)

---

## Key Distinctions

### Roles vs Professional Levels

**Roles** (Access Control):
- Determine what users can ACCESS
- Examples: admin, member
- Stored in: `model_has_roles` table
- Used for: Permissions, middleware, guards

**Professional Levels** (Progression):
- Determine user's PROGRESSION status
- Examples: Associate, Professional, Senior, etc.
- Stored in: `users.professional_level` field (1-7)
- Used for: Earnings calculations, commission rates, benefits

---

## Terminology Alignment

### Before (Investment-Based)

- ❌ "Investor" role
- ❌ "Investment" management
- ❌ "Create investments"
- ❌ Investment-focused UI

### After (Subscription-Based)

- ✅ "Member" role
- ✅ "Subscription" management
- ✅ "Create subscription"
- ✅ Subscription-focused UI

---

## Migration Path

### For New Users

```php
// When registering new users
$user->assignRole('member');
$user->professional_level = 1; // Associate
```

### For Existing Users

**Option 1: Automatic Migration** (Recommended)
```php
// Migrate all 'investor' users to 'member'
$investors = User::role('investor')->get();
foreach ($investors as $user) {
    $user->assignRole('member');
    // Keep 'investor' role for backward compatibility
}
```

**Option 2: Gradual Migration**
- Keep both roles assigned
- Update UI to use 'member' terminology
- Remove 'investor' role in future update

---

## Updated Permissions List

### Admin Permissions (Full Access)
- All permissions

### Member Permissions
- `view_member_dashboard`
- `create_subscription`
- `cancel_subscription`
- `view_personal_reports`
- `view_personal_matrix`

### Manager Permissions (Legacy)

- [x] Roles seeded successfully
- [x] Permissions created/updated
- [ ] Test member role assignment
- [ ] Test member dashboard access
- [ ] Test subscription creation
- [ ] Test professional level progression
- [ ] Verify no conflicts between roles and levels

- [ ] Verify legacy roles still work

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Done)

- [x] Run seeder

### Short Term (This Week)
- [ ] Update user registration to assign 'member' role

## Code Examples

### Assign Member Role on Registration

```php
// In RegisterController or registration action
$user = User::create([
    'name' => $request->name,
    'email' => $request->email,
    'password' => Hash::make($request->password),
    'professional_level' => 1, // Associate
]);

$user->assignRole('member');
```

### Check Member Role in Middleware

```php
// In routes or middleware
Route::middleware(['auth', 'role:member'])->group(function () {
    Route::get('/dashboard', [DashboardController::class, 'index']);
    Route::get('/subscriptions', [SubscriptionController::class, 'index']);
});
```

### Check Professional Level

```php
// In controllers or services
if ($user->professional_level >= 4) {
    // Manager level or higher
    // Apply higher commission rates
}
```

## Documentation Updates

### Files Updated
1. `database/seeders/RoleSeeder.php` - Updated roles and permissions
2. `ROLES_ALIGNMENT_ANALYSIS.md` - Analysis document
3. `ROLES_UPDATE_COMPLETE.md` - This summary

### Files to Update (Future)
- User registration controllers
- Authentication middleware
- Dashboard controllers
- UI components (replace "investor" with "member")
- API documentation

---

## Important Notes

### 1. Roles ≠ Professional Levels

**Don't confuse**:
- Role: "member" (access control)
- Professional Level: "Manager" (progression level 4)

### 2. Backward Compatibility

Legacy roles ('investor', 'manager') are kept for:
- Existing user assignments
- Gradual migration
- Avoiding breaking changes

### 3. Subscription vs Investment

**Subscription** (Primary):
- Members subscribe for platform access
- Monthly/annual packages
- Learning materials, coaching, mentorship

**Investment** (Secondary):
- Community project investments only
- Separate from platform subscriptions
- Profit-sharing model

---

## Verification

### Check Roles Exist

```bash
php artisan tinker
```

```php
// Check roles
Spatie\Permission\Models\Role::all()->pluck('name');
// Should show: ["admin", "member", "investor", "manager"]

// Check member role permissions
$member = Spatie\Permission\Models\Role::findByName('member');
$member->permissions->pluck('name');
```

### Check Permissions

```php
// Check subscription permissions exist
Spatie\Permission\Models\Permission::where('name', 'like', '%subscription%')->pluck('name');

// Check points permissions exist
Spatie\Permission\Models\Permission::where('name', 'like', '%points%')->pluck('name');
```
