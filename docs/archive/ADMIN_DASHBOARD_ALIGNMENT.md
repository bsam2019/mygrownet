4. Add professional level distribution

### Phase 2: Charts & Visualizations (Medium Priority)
5. Member growth trend chart
6. Revenue trend (subscriptions)
7. Professional level bar chart
8. Matrix network health

### Phase 3: Engagement & Details (Low Priority)
9. Recent activity feed
10. Alerts system
11. Quick actions
12. Profit-sharing metrics

## Files to Modify

   - Update `index()` method
   - Change metrics from investments to subscriptions

   - Add professional level data

### Frontend
2. `resources/js/pages/Admin/Dashboard/Index.vue`

**Key Changes Needed:**
- ❌ Remove all investment terminology
- ✅ Add subscription/member terminology
- ✅ Add points system metrics
- ✅ Add matrix network metrics
- ✅ Add professional level tracking
- ✅ Add profit-sharing metrics (from community projects)
- ✅ Focus on member engagement, not investment returns
