## Security

### Superadmin Only:
- Create roles
- Edit roles
- Delete roles
- Manage permissions

### Admin & Superadmin:
- Assign roles to users
- Remove roles from users
- View roles and permissions

### Protected:
- System roles (superadmin, admin, employee, member) cannot be edited or deleted
- Superadmin role permissions cannot be modified
- Cannot delete roles with users assigned
- Only superadmin can assign superadmin role

---

## Toast Notifications

All actions show toast notifications:
- **Success** (Green) - Action completed
- **Error** (Red) - Action failed
- Auto-dismiss after 3 seconds

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Create Role" button not showing
**Check**:
1. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
3. Verify you're logged in as admin/superadmin

### PUT method not allowed error
**Fixed**: Routes are correctly configured with PUT method

### Permissions page has no buttons
**By Design**: Permissions are managed through roles, not directly
- Go to Roles → View → Edit Permissions
