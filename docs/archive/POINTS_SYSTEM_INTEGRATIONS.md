## ✅ Completed Integrations

### 1. Referral System Integration

**Event**: `UserReferred`  
**Listener**: `AwardReferralPoints`  
**Points Awarded**: 150 LP + 150 MAP

**How it works**:
- When a user successfully refers someone who makes their first investment
- The referrer automatically receives 150 LP and 150 MAP
- Points are awarded only once per referral (on first investment)

**Files Modified**:
- `app/Services/ReferralService.php` - Fires `UserReferred` event
- `app/Events/UserReferred.php` - Event class
- `app/Listeners/AwardReferralPoints.php` - Listener class

**Testing**:
```php
// When a new user makes their first investment with a referrer
$investment = Investment::create([...]);
$referralService->processReferralCommission($investment);
// Referrer automatically gets 150 LP + 150 MAP
```

---

### 2. Course Completion Integration

**Event**: `CourseCompleted`  
**Listener**: `AwardCourseCompletionPoints`  
**Points Awarded**: 
- Basic courses: 30 LP + 30 MAP
- Intermediate courses: 45 LP + 45 MAP
- Advanced courses: 60 LP + 60 MAP

**How it works**:
- When a user completes a course (marks it as completed)
- Points are automatically awarded based on course difficulty
- Event is fired from `CourseEnrollment::markCompleted()` method

**Files Modified**:
- `app/Models/CourseEnrollment.php` - Fires `CourseCompleted` event
- `app/Events/CourseCompleted.php` - Event class
- `app/Listeners/AwardCourseCompletionPoints.php` - Listener class

**Testing**:
```php
// When a user completes a course
$enrollment = CourseEnrollment::find($id);
$enrollment->markCompleted();
// User automatically gets 30-60 LP + MAP based on difficulty
```

---

### 3. Product Sales Integration

**Event**: `ProductSold`  
**Listener**: `AwardProductSalePoints`  
**Points Awarded**: 10 LP + 10 MAP per K100 (minimum 10 points)

**How it works**:
- When a user makes a product sale
- Points are calculated based on sale amount
- K100 = 10 points, K500 = 50 points, etc.
- Minimum 10 points for any sale

**Files Created**:
- `app/Events/ProductSold.php` - Event class
- `app/Listeners/AwardProductSalePoints.php` - Listener class

**Usage**:
```php
// Fire this event when a product sale is recorded
event(new ProductSold($sale));
// User automatically gets points based on sale amount
```

---

### 4. Level Advancement Integration

**Event**: `UserLevelAdvanced`  
**Listener**: `AwardDownlineAdvancementPoints`  
**Points Awarded**: 50 LP + 50 MAP to referrer

**How it works**:
- When a user advances to a new professional level
- Their direct referrer receives 50 LP + 50 MAP
- Rewards mentors for helping their team grow

**Files Modified**:
- `app/Services/LevelAdvancementService.php` - Fires `UserLevelAdvanced` event
- `app/Events/UserLevelAdvanced.php` - Event class
- `app/Listeners/AwardDownlineAdvancementPoints.php` - Listener class

**Testing**:
```php
// When a user meets requirements and advances
$levelService->checkLevelAdvancement($user);
// Their referrer automatically gets 50 LP + 50 MAP
```

---

### 5. Daily Login Tracking

**Middleware**: `TrackDailyLogin`  
**Points Awarded**: 5 MAP per day

**How it works**:
- Automatically tracks when users log in
- Awards 5 MAP once per day (not per login)
- Checks for streak bonuses (7-day, 30-day)

**Streak Bonuses**:
- 7-day streak: +50 MAP
- 30-day streak: +200 MAP

**Files Created**:
- `app/Http/Middleware/TrackDailyLogin.php` - Middleware class

**Files Modified**:
- `bootstrap/app.php` - Registered middleware in web group

**Testing**:
- User logs in → Automatically gets 5 MAP (once per day)
- After 7 consecutive days → Gets bonus 50 MAP
- After 30 consecutive days → Gets bonus 200 MAP

---

## Event Registration

All events and listeners are registered in `app/Providers/EventServiceProvider.php`:

```php
protected $listen = [
    \App\Events\UserReferred::class => [
        \App\Listeners\AwardReferralPoints::class,
    ],
    \App\Events\CourseCompleted::class => [
        \App\Listeners\AwardCourseCompletionPoints::class,
    ],
    \App\Events\ProductSold::class => [
        \App\Listeners\AwardProductSalePoints::class,
    ],
    \App\Events\UserLevelAdvanced::class => [
        \App\Listeners\AwardDownlineAdvancementPoints::class,
    ],
];
```

## How to Use Product Sales Integration

Since the product sales system may not be fully implemented yet, here's how to integrate it:

### Option 1: Fire Event Manually

```php
// In your sales controller or service
use App\Events\ProductSold;

public function recordSale(Request $request)
{
    $sale = Sale::create([
        'user_id' => auth()->id(),
        'amount' => $request->amount,
        // ... other fields
    ]);

    // Fire event to award points
    event(new ProductSold($sale));

    return response()->json(['success' => true]);
}
```

### Option 2: Add to Sale Model

```php
// In app/Models/Sale.php
protected static function booted()
{
    static::created(function ($sale) {
        event(new \App\Events\ProductSold($sale));
    });
}
```

---

## Testing the Integrations

### 1. Test Referral Points

```bash
php artisan tinker
```

```php
$user = User::find(1);
$referee = User::find(2);
event(new App\Events\UserReferred($user, $referee));

// Check points
$user->points->refresh();
echo "LP: " . $user->points->lifetime_points;
echo "MAP: " . $user->points->monthly_points;
```

### 2. Test Course Completion

```php
$enrollment = App\Models\CourseEnrollment::first();
$enrollment->markCompleted();

// Check user points
$enrollment->user->points->refresh();
```

### 3. Test Daily Login

```bash
# Just log in to the application
# Points are automatically awarded via middleware
```

### 4. Test Product Sale

```php
$sale = (object)[
    'id' => 1,
    'user' => User::find(1),
    'amount' => 500
];

event(new App\Events\ProductSold($sale));
```

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Check Integration Health

```bash
# View recent point transactions
php artisan tinker
```

```php
// See recent point awards by source
App\Models\PointTransaction::select('source', DB::raw('count(*) as count'), DB::raw('sum(lp_amount) as total_lp'))
    ->groupBy('source')
    ->orderBy('count', 'desc')
    ->get();
```

### Admin Dashboard Metrics

The admin points dashboard (`/admin/points`) shows:
- Total points awarded by source
- Most active users
- Recent transactions
- Monthly trends

---

## Troubleshooting

### Points Not Being Awarded

1. **Check event is firing**
```php
// Add to listener handle method
Log::info('Event received', ['event' => get_class($event)]);
```

2. **Check queue is running**
```bash
php artisan queue:work
```

3. **Check user has points record**
```php
$user->points()->firstOrCreate(['user_id' => $user->id]);
```

### Duplicate Points

- Daily login points have built-in duplicate prevention
- Other activities should fire events only once per action
- Check your event firing logic

### Points Not Showing

```bash
# Clear caches
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan config:clear
php artisan view:clear

# Rebuild frontend
npm run build
```

---

## Configuration

### Adjust Point Values

Edit `app/Listeners/Award*Points.php` files to change point amounts:

```php
// Example: Increase referral points
$this->pointService->awardPoints(
    user: $event->referrer,
    source: 'direct_referral',
    lpAmount: 200, // Changed from 150
    mapAmount: 200, // Changed from 150
    description: "Referred {$event->referee->name}",
    reference: $event->referee
);
```

### Disable Specific Integrations

Comment out in `EventServiceProvider.php`:

```php
protected $listen = [
    // \App\Events\ProductSold::class => [
    //     \App\Listeners\AwardProductSalePoints::class,
    // ],
];
```

---

## Performance Considerations

### Queue Processing

All listeners implement `ShouldQueue` interface:
- Point awards happen asynchronously
- Doesn't slow down user actions
- Requires queue worker running

```bash
# Start queue worker
php artisan queue:work

# Or use supervisor in production
```

### Database Impact

- Each point award creates 1 transaction record
- User points updated via increment (efficient)
- Indexes on `user_id` and `source` for fast queries

---

## Security

### Validation

- All point awards go through `PointService`
- User authentication checked
- Duplicate prevention built-in
- Audit trail maintained

### Fraud Prevention

- Daily login: Once per day limit
- Referrals: Only on first investment
- Course completion: Only when status changes
- All transactions logged with references

---

## Success Metrics

Track these KPIs to measure integration success:

1. **Engagement Rate**: % of users earning points daily
2. **Activity Distribution**: Which sources generate most points
3. **Qualification Rate**: % of users meeting monthly MAP
4. **Streak Retention**: Average login streak length
5. **Course Completion**: Rate before/after points integration

---
