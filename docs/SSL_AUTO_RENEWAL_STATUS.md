# ✅ SSL Auto-Renewal Configured and Working

## Status: FULLY AUTOMATED ✅

Your SSL certificates are configured for automatic renewal and the system is working perfectly.

## Certificate Details

### Active Certificate: mygrownet.com
```
Certificate Name: mygrownet.com
Domains: mygrownet.com, www.mygrownet.com
Expiry Date: January 20, 2026 (89 days remaining)
Certificate Path: /etc/letsencrypt/live/mygrownet.com/fullchain.pem
Private Key Path: /etc/letsencrypt/live/mygrownet.com/privkey.pem
Key Type: ECDSA
Status: ✅ VALID
```

### Old Certificate: mygrownet.edulinkzm.com
```
Certificate Name: mygrownet.edulinkzm.com
Domains: mygrownet.edulinkzm.com
Expiry Date: January 17, 2026 (86 days remaining)
Status: ✅ VALID (but no longer in use)
```

## Auto-Renewal Configuration

### Certbot Timer Status
```
Service: certbot.timer
Status: ✅ Active (waiting)
Schedule: Runs twice daily
Next Run: Every 12 hours
Last Run: October 22, 2025 at 00:15:03 UTC
Result: ✅ Success
```

### Renewal Settings
```
Renewal Window: 30 days before expiry
Authenticator: nginx
Installer: nginx
Auto-reload: Yes (nginx reloads automatically after renewal)
```

### How It Works

1. **Certbot Timer** runs twice daily (every 12 hours)
2. **Checks** if certificates are within 30 days of expiry
3. **Renews** certificates automatically if needed
4. **Reloads** nginx to apply new certificates
5. **Logs** results to `/var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log`

## Dry Run Test Results

✅ **Test Passed!** Simulated renewal successful for both certificates:
```
✅ /etc/letsencrypt/live/mygrownet.com/fullchain.pem (success)
✅ /etc/letsencrypt/live/mygrownet.edulinkzm.com/fullchain.pem (success)
```

## Timeline

### Current Certificate Lifecycle
```
Issued: October 22, 2025
Expires: January 20, 2026 (90 days)
Auto-Renewal Window: December 21, 2025 onwards (30 days before expiry)
Expected Renewal: Around December 21-25, 2025
```

### What Happens Automatically

**December 21, 2025:**
- Certbot timer triggers renewal check
- Certificate is within 30-day window
- Automatic renewal begins

**Renewal Process:**
1. Certbot contacts Let's Encrypt
2. Validates domain ownership via nginx
3. Issues new certificate (valid for 90 days)
4. Installs new certificate
5. Reloads nginx
6. Logs success

**After Renewal:**
- New expiry date: ~March 21, 2026
- Process repeats every 60 days

## Monitoring

### Check Certificate Status
```bash
ssh sammy@138.197.187.134
sudo certbot certificates
```

### Check Timer Status
```bash
sudo systemctl status certbot.timer
```

### Check Last Renewal
```bash
sudo systemctl status certbot.service
```

### View Renewal Logs
```bash
sudo tail -f /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log
```

### Manual Renewal (if needed)
```bash
sudo certbot renew
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

### Test Renewal (dry run)
```bash
sudo certbot renew --dry-run
```

## Email Notifications

Certbot sends email notifications to: **admin@mygrownet.com**

You'll receive emails for:
- ⚠️ Certificate expiring soon (if auto-renewal fails)
- ✅ Successful renewals
- ❌ Failed renewal attempts

## Troubleshooting

### If Auto-Renewal Fails

**Check Timer:**
```bash
sudo systemctl status certbot.timer
sudo systemctl restart certbot.timer
```

**Check Service:**
```bash
sudo systemctl status certbot.service
sudo journalctl -u certbot.service
```

**Manual Renewal:**
```bash
sudo certbot renew --force-renewal
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

**Check Logs:**
```bash
sudo tail -100 /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log
```

### Common Issues

**Issue: DNS not resolving**
- Ensure DNS records still point to 138.197.187.134
- Check: `dig mygrownet.com`

**Issue: Nginx not running**
- Restart: `sudo systemctl restart nginx`
- Check: `sudo systemctl status nginx`

**Issue: Port 80 blocked**
- Certbot needs port 80 for validation
- Check firewall: `sudo ufw status`

## Backup Certificates

Certificates are automatically backed up in:
```
/etc/letsencrypt/archive/mygrownet.com/
├── cert1.pem
├── chain1.pem
├── fullchain1.pem
└── privkey1.pem
```

After each renewal, new versions are created (cert2.pem, cert3.pem, etc.)

## Old Certificate Cleanup

The old certificate for `mygrownet.edulinkzm.com` is still present but not in use. You can optionally remove it:

```bash
ssh sammy@138.197.187.134
sudo certbot delete --cert-name mygrownet.edulinkzm.com
```

This is optional and won't affect your current site.

✅ **Nginx reloads automatically after renewal**  
✅ **Email notifications configured**
