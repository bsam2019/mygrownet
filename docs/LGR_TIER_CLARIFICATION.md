## Technical Implementation

### Database Check

**Premium Tier Verification**:
```sql
SELECT 
    u.id,
    u.name,
    u.starter_kit_tier,
    CASE 
        WHEN u.starter_kit_tier = 'premium' THEN 'LGR Qualified'
        ELSE 'Not Qualified'
    END as lgr_status
FROM users u
WHERE u.has_starter_kit = true;
```

### Service Layer

**LgrQualificationService**:
```php
public function checkQualification(int $userId): array
{
    $user = User::find($userId);
    
    // Only premium tier qualifies
    if ($user->starter_kit_tier !== 'premium') {
        return [
            'qualified' => false,
            'reason' => 'LGR is only available for Premium Starter Kit members',
        ];
    }
    
    // Continue with qualification checks...
}
```

**Payment Verification**:
```php
// Automatically detects tier from payment amount
$amount = $payment->amount()->value();
$tier = $amount == 1000 ? 'premium' : 'basic';

// Only premium gets LGR access
if ($tier === 'premium') {
    // Enable LGR qualification
}
```
