## Security and Compliance

### Audit Trail

All withdrawal management activities are logged with:

- **Timestamp**: When the action occurred
- **Action Details**: What was done
- **Request Information**: Which withdrawal was affected
- **Reason/Justification**: Why the action was taken

### Dual Approval Process

For high-value or emergency withdrawals:
1. **Primary Approval**: First administrator reviews and approves
2. **Secondary Approval**: Second administrator confirms approval
3. **System Validation**: Automated checks before processing
4. **Audit Logging**: Complete trail of approval process
