# ✅ CORS Issue Fixed!

## Problem
When accessing the site via `https://www.mygrownet.com`, assets were being loaded from `https://mygrownet.com`, causing a CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) error:

```
Access to script at 'https://mygrownet.com/build/assets/app-DC23U-iZ.js' 
from origin 'https://www.mygrownet.com' has been blocked by CORS policy
```

## Solution
Implemented a proper www to non-www redirect at the nginx level. Now:

1. **HTTP requests** → Redirect to `https://mygrownet.com`
2. **https://www.mygrownet.com** → Redirect to `https://mygrownet.com`
3. **https://mygrownet.com** → Serves the application

## Configuration

### Nginx Server Blocks

**Block 1: HTTP to HTTPS**
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name mygrownet.com www.mygrownet.com 138.197.187.134;
    return 301 https://mygrownet.com$request_uri;
}
```

**Block 2: WWW to Non-WWW Redirect**
```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name www.mygrownet.com;
    
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/mygrownet.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/mygrownet.com/privkey.pem;
    
    return 301 https://mygrownet.com$request_uri;
}
```

**Block 3: Main Application Server**
```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name mygrownet.com;
    root /var/www/mygrownet.com/public;
    # ... rest of configuration
}
```

## Verification

### Test Results

**WWW Redirect:**
```bash
$ curl -I https://www.mygrownet.com
HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Location: https://mygrownet.com/
```

**Non-WWW (Main Site):**
```bash
$ curl -I https://mygrownet.com
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
```

**HTTP Redirect:**
```bash
$ curl -I http://mygrownet.com
HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Location: https://mygrownet.com/
```

## For Users

### Clear Your Browser Cache

To see the fix, users need to clear their browser cache:

**Chrome/Edge:**
1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+Delete` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+Delete` (Mac)
2. Select "Cached images and files"
3. Click "Clear data"
4. Or use hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)

**Firefox:**
1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+Delete` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+Delete` (Mac)
2. Select "Cache"
3. Click "Clear Now"
4. Or use hard refresh: `Ctrl+F5` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)

**Safari:**
1. Press `Cmd+Option+E` to empty caches
2. Or go to Develop → Empty Caches
3. Hard refresh: `Cmd+Option+R`

### Alternative: Incognito/Private Mode
Open the site in an incognito/private browsing window to bypass cache.

## Technical Details

### Why This Happened
1. The site was initially configured to serve both www and non-www from the same server block
2. When accessed via www, Laravel generated asset URLs based on the APP_URL (non-www)
3. Browser saw this as cross-origin request (www.mygrownet.com → mygrownet.com)
4. CORS policy blocked the asset loading

### Why This Fix Works
1. All traffic is now redirected to the canonical domain (non-www)
2. No cross-origin requests occur
3. All assets load from the same origin
4. Browser security policies are satisfied

## Files Updated

- **Nginx Config:** `/etc/nginx/sites-available/mygrownet.com`
- **Local Copy:** `mygrownet-nginx.conf` (in project root)

## Status

✅ **CORS issue resolved**  
✅ **WWW redirect working**  
✅ **Non-WWW site working**  
✅ **HTTP to HTTPS redirect working**  
✅ **SSL certificates valid**  

## Canonical URL

The canonical URL for the site is now:
**https://mygrownet.com** (without www)

All other variations redirect to this URL.
