## How It Works

### 1. Team Building
- As you build your network across 7 levels, your team members earn Lifetime Points (LP)
- LP is earned through various activities: referrals, courses, subscriptions, purchases, etc.

### 2. Bonus Pool Distribution
- The company allocates a bonus pool for each level based on team performance
- Your share of the bonus pool is proportional to your team's LP contribution
- Formula: **Your Bonus = (Your Team LP ÷ Total Level LP) × Level Bonus Pool**

### 3. Level Progression
- **Level 1:** Starting level - 3 direct referrals (250 LP average each)
- **Level 2:** 9 team members - K5,000 bonus pool (208 LP average)
- **Level 3:** 27 team members - K8,000 bonus pool (103 LP average)
- **Level 4:** 81 team members - K25,000 bonus pool (104 LP average)
- **Level 5:** 243 team members - K120,000 bonus pool (165 LP average)
- **Level 6:** 729 team members - K320,000 bonus pool (147 LP average)
- **Level 7:** 2,187 team members - K700,000 bonus pool (107 LP average)

## Example Calculation

### Scenario: Level 5 Position Bonus

**Given:**
- Level 5 Bonus Pool: K120,000
- Your team's total LP: 40,000 LP
- Total LP at Level 5: 60,000 LP

**Calculation:**
```
Your Bonus = (40,000 ÷ 60,000) × K120,000
Your Bonus = 0.6667 × K120,000
Your Bonus = K80,000
```

## Key Benefits

1. **Scalable Rewards:** Bonus pools increase exponentially with team size
2. **Performance-Based:** Rewards active team building and member engagement
3. **Fair Distribution:** Based on actual LP contribution, not just team size
4. **Long-Term Value:** Encourages sustainable network growth

## Relationship with Professional Levels

Position Bonuses complement the Professional Level advancement system:

| Professional Level | LP Required | Milestone Bonus | Position Bonus Eligibility |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| Associate         | 0           | -               | Level 1-2                 |
| Professional      | 500         | K500 + 100 LP   | Level 2-3                 |
| Senior            | 1,500       | K1,500 + 200 LP | Level 3-4                 |
| Manager           | 4,000       | K5,000 + 500 LP | Level 4-5                 |
| Director          | 10,000      | K15,000 + 1,000 LP | Level 5-6              |
| Executive         | 25,000      | K50,000 + 2,500 LP | Level 6-7              |
| Ambassador        | 50,000      | K150,000 + 5,000 LP | Level 7                |
