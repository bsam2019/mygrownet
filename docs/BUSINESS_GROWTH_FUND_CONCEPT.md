# MyGrowNet Business Growth Fund (BGF)

**Concept Note & Implementation Plan**  
**Last Updated:** October 30, 2025  
**Status:** 📋 Documentation Complete - Ready for Implementation  
**Legal Framework:** Zambian Law Compliant

---

## Executive Summary

The MyGrowNet Business Growth Fund (BGF) is a **business partnership model** that provides short-term financing support to active members who have verified business orders or opportunities but lack sufficient working capital.

**Key Distinction:** BGF is NOT a loan facility or investment fund. It operates as a **profit-sharing partnership** on specific business transactions.

---

## 1. Background and Rationale

### The Problem
Access to finance remains one of the greatest challenges facing entrepreneurs and small business owners in Zambia. Many individuals and SMEs have viable business opportunities but fail to execute them due to lack of timely funding, especially when large orders or contracts arise.

### The Solution
MyGrowNet, operating under Rockshield Investments Limited, introduces the Business Growth Fund (BGF) — a structured initiative that helps active members access short-term support for fulfilling verified business orders or implementing viable income-generating ventures.

### Legal Positioning
The BGF operates as a **business partnership model** where MyGrowNet temporarily supports approved member ventures and shares profits upon successful completion. This structure avoids regulatory issues with:
- Bank of Zambia Act
- Banking and Financial Services Act
- Securities Act

---

## 2. Purpose of the Fund

The BGF aims to:

1. **Support Members** who receive business orders or opportunities but lack sufficient working capital
2. **Strengthen Entrepreneurial Capacity** of MyGrowNet members
3. **Demonstrate Commitment** to inclusive economic empowerment
4. **Build Track Record** of successful member-led ventures that attract investors and partners
5. **Create Sustainable Revenue** through profit-sharing arrangements

---

## 3. Objectives

### Primary Objectives
- Provide conditional business financing support to verified opportunities
- Promote responsible entrepreneurship and financial discipline among members
- Generate profit-sharing opportunities that strengthen MyGrowNet's sustainability
- Encourage networking and collaborative business growth among members

### Success Metrics
- Empower at least 100 members in the first year through project financing
- Enable small enterprises to fulfill orders worth over ZMW 1 million collectively
- Increase member retention, loyalty, and trust in MyGrowNet's ecosystem
- Demonstrate social impact for attracting investors and government collaboration

---

## 4. Legal and Compliance Framework

### Core Principles

To remain compliant under Zambian laws, the BGF operates under these principles:

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **No Deposit-Taking** | Members will not deposit money into the fund with expectations of interest or guaranteed returns |
| **Company-Financed Fund** | The fund is financed from MyGrowNet's operational revenue, training subscriptions, and business profits |
| **Profit-Sharing Model** | Support provided is not a loan but a co-investment partnership on specific business transactions |
| **Voluntary Participation** | Members may propose projects but cannot demand or guarantee support |
| **Clear Contracts** | Each approved project has a written profit-sharing agreement between MyGrowNet and the beneficiary |
| **Transaction-Specific** | Funding tied to specific business transactions, not general personal loans |

### Future Expansion
If the fund later expands, MyGrowNet may establish a separate cooperative or investment subsidiary to manage pooled capital legally.
