## 3. Reward Structure

### 3.1 Basic Parameters

| Element | Value | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| **Cycle Duration** | 70 days | Maximum earning period |
| **Daily Rate** | Up to K25 | Activity-dependent |
| **Maximum Total** | K1,750 | 70 days × K25 |
| **Reward Type** | Loyalty Growth Credits (LGC) | Stored in MyGrowNet Wallet |
| **Payout Condition** | Active participation days only | No activity = no payout |

### 3.2 Daily Earning Logic

**Active Day Definition:**
A day counts as "active" if the member performs at least ONE of:
- Logs in and completes a learning module
- Makes a marketplace transaction
- Attends a scheduled event
- Completes a platform task
- Engages in community activities

**Example Calculation:**
```
Member active for 55 of 70 days:
55 days × K25 = K1,375 in Loyalty Credits

Member active for 70 of 70 days:
70 days × K25 = K1,750 in Loyalty Credits (maximum)
```

### 3.3 Source of Funds

LGR rewards are derived from a **dedicated reward pool** funded by:

| Revenue Source | Contribution to Pool |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Registration fees (K1,000 Starter Packages) | 20% |
| Digital product sales | 15% |
| Marketplace transaction fees | 10% |
| Venture Builder facilitation fees | 10% |
| Subscription renewals | 15% |

**Pool Allocation Example:**
```
100 new members × K1,000 = K100,000 revenue

Allocation:
- Starter product costs: K30,000 (30%)
- Operations & management: K20,000 (20%)
- LGR Reward Pool: K20,000 (20%)
- Venture Builder fund: K15,000 (15%)
- Other allocations: K15,000 (15%)
```

## 4. Legal & Financial Safety Design

### 4.1 Compliance Protections

| Protection | Description | Legal Benefit |
|------------|-------------|---------------|
| **No Fixed Returns** | Rewards based on available pool funds | Not an investment product |
| **Activity-Based** | Must perform tasks to earn | Not passive income |
| **Wallet Credits First** | Paid as LGC, not direct cash | Platform economy |
| **Conversion Caps** | Max 40% convertible to cash | Funds stay in ecosystem |
| **Transparent Pool** | Visible pool balance | No hidden promises |
| **Dynamic Adjustment** | Payouts adjust to revenue | Sustainable |

### 4.2 Proportional Distribution

When demand exceeds available pool:

**Example:**
```
25 members qualify for full cycle (K1,750 each)
Total potential payout: 25 × K1,750 = K43,750
Available pool: K20,000

Proportional payout:
Each member receives: (K20,000 ÷ K43,750) × K1,750 = K788

This ensures MyGrowNet never overpays.
```

### 4.3 Sustainability Measures

**Pool Monitoring:**
- Real-time pool balance tracking
- Automatic adjustment of daily rates
- Warning system when pool is low
- Transparent communication to members

**Reserve Requirements:**
- Minimum 30% reserve maintained
- Emergency fund for operational continuity
- Quarterly audits and reconciliation
