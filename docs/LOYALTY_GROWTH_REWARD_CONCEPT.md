## 3. Reward Structure

### 3.1 Basic Parameters

| Element | Value | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| **Cycle Duration** | 70 days | Maximum earning period |
| **Daily Rate** | Up to K30 | Activity-dependent |
| **Maximum Total** | K2,100 | 70 days × K30 |
| **Reward Type** | Loyalty Growth Credits (LGC) | Stored in MyGrowNet Wallet |
| **Payout Condition** | Active participation days only | No activity = no payout |

### 3.2 Daily Earning Logic

**Active Day Definition:**
A day counts as "active" if the member performs at least ONE of:
- Logs in and completes a learning module
- Makes a marketplace transaction
- Attends a scheduled event
- Completes a platform task
- Engages in community activities

**Example Calculation:**
```
Member active for 55 of 70 days:
55 days × K30 = K1,650 in Loyalty Credits

Member active for 70 of 70 days:
70 days × K30 = K2,100 in Loyalty Credits (maximum)
```

### 3.3 Source of Funds

LGR rewards are derived from a **dedicated reward pool** funded by:

| Revenue Source | Contribution to Pool |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Registration fees (K1,000 Starter Packages) | 20% |
| Digital product sales | 15% |
| Marketplace transaction fees | 10% |
| Venture Builder facilitation fees | 10% |
| Subscription renewals | 15% |

**Pool Allocation Example:**
```
100 new members × K1,000 = K100,000 revenue

Allocation:
- Starter product costs: K30,000 (30%)
- Operations & management: K20,000 (20%)
- LGR Reward Pool: K20,000 (20%)
- Venture Builder fund: K15,000 (15%)
- Other allocations: K15,000 (15%)
```

## 4. Legal & Financial Safety Design

### 4.1 Compliance Protections

| Protection | Description | Legal Benefit |
|------------|-------------|---------------|
| **No Fixed Returns** | Rewards based on available pool funds | Not an investment product |
| **Activity-Based** | Must perform tasks to earn | Not passive income |
| **Wallet Credits First** | Paid as LGC, not direct cash | Platform economy |
| **Conversion Caps** | Max 40% convertible to cash | Funds stay in ecosystem |
| **Transparent Pool** | Visible pool balance | No hidden promises |
| **Dynamic Adjustment** | Payouts adjust to revenue | Sustainable |

### 4.2 Proportional Distribution

When demand exceeds available pool:

**Example:**
```
25 members qualify for full cycle (K2,100 each)
Total potential payout: 25 × K2,100 = K52,500
Available pool: K20,000

Proportional payout:
Each member receives: (K20,000 ÷ K52,500) × K2,100 = K800

This ensures MyGrowNet never overpays.
```

### 4.3 Sustainability Measures

**Pool Monitoring:**
- Real-time pool balance tracking
- Automatic adjustment of daily rates
- Warning system when pool is low
- Transparent communication to members

**Reserve Requirements:**
- Minimum 30% reserve maintained
- Emergency fund for operational continuity
- Quarterly audits and reconciliation

## 19. Current Implementation Status (January 31, 2026)

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Activity Tracking Not Connected

**Status**: Infrastructure complete, but automatic activity tracking is **NOT integrated** with user actions.

#### What Works ✅
- Database schema and migrations
- Service layer (`LgrActivityTrackingService`)
- Qualification system
- Member dashboard
- Admin dashboard
- Cycle management

#### What's Missing ❌

**Problem**: The `LgrActivityTrackingService` exists but is **NEVER CALLED** from actual user actions.

**Missing Integrations**:

1. **Learning Module Completion** - Not connected
   ```php
   // NEEDED in lesson completion controller:
   app(LgrActivityTrackingService::class)->recordLearningActivity(
       auth()->id(), 
       $lesson->title
   );
   ```

2. **Marketplace Purchases** - Not connected
   ```php
   // NEEDED in order completion:
   app(LgrActivityTrackingService::class)->recordMarketplacePurchase(
       auth()->id(),
       $order->id,
       $order->total
   );
   ```

3. **Event Attendance** - Not connected
4. **Community Engagement** - Not connected
5. **Quiz Completion** - Not connected
6. **Business Plan Completion** - Not connected

#### Impact on Members

**Current Reality**:
- Members can qualify for LGR ✅
- Members can start 70-day cycles ✅
- Members complete activities ✅
- **Activities are NOT automatically tracked** ❌
- **K30 daily credits are NOT awarded** ❌
- Members cannot earn the promised K2,100 ❌

#### Required Fixes (Priority: HIGH)

**Phase 1: Connect Activity Tracking** (Week 1-2)
- [ ] Identify all controllers where qualifying activities occur
- [ ] Add `LgrActivityTrackingService` calls after successful actions
- [ ] Test automatic recording
- [ ] Verify K30 credits awarded

**Phase 2: Add Daily Task UI** (Week 2-3)
- [ ] Create daily task checklist component
- [ ] Show "Complete today's activity to earn K30"
- [ ] Add quick links to qualifying activities
- [ ] Display completion status

**Phase 3: Verify Automation** (Week 3-4)
- [ ] Confirm scheduled jobs running
- [ ] Test cycle completion
- [ ] Verify payout processing
- [ ] Launch to members

#### Files Requiring Updates

**Controllers to Modify**:
1. `app/Http/Controllers/Training/LessonController.php` - Add learning tracking
2. `app/Http/Controllers/Marketplace/OrderController.php` - Add purchase tracking
3. `app/Http/Controllers/Workshop/AttendanceController.php` - Add event tracking
4. `app/Http/Controllers/Community/PostController.php` - Add engagement tracking
5. `app/Http/Controllers/Training/QuizController.php` - Add quiz tracking
6. `app/Http/Controllers/BusinessPlan/PlanController.php` - Add plan tracking

**Service Available**:
- `app/Services/LgrActivityTrackingService.php` (ready to use)

#### Temporary Workaround

Until automatic tracking is implemented, members can manually record activities:

```javascript
// POST /mygrownet/loyalty-reward/record-activity
{
  "activity_type": "learning_module",
  "description": "Completed lesson",
  "metadata": {}
}
```

## 20. Package Management System (January 31, 2026)

### Overview

A flexible package management system allows admins to configure multiple LGR packages with different investment amounts, daily rates, and earning cycles.

### Package Structure

Each package includes:
- **Package Amount**: Initial investment required (e.g., K300, K500, K1000, K2000)
- **Daily LGR Rate**: Amount earned per active day (e.g., K10, K15, K30, K60)
- **Duration Days**: Length of earning cycle (e.g., 50, 70 days)
- **Total Reward**: Maximum earnings (Daily Rate × Duration)
- **ROI**: Return on investment percentage
- **Features**: List of package benefits
- **Status**: Active/Inactive

### Default Packages

| Package | Amount | Daily LGR | Duration | Total Reward | ROI |
|---------|--------|-----------|----------|--------------|-----|
| Package 1 | K300 | K10 | 50 days | K500 | 166.67% |
| Package 2 | K500 | K15 | 70 days | K1,050 | 210% |
| Package 3 | K1,000 | K30 | 70 days | K2,100 | 210% |
| Package 4 | K2,000 | K60 | 70 days | K4,200 | 210% |

### Admin Interface

### Database Schema

**Table**: `lgr_packages`

```sql
- id
- name (Package 1, Package 2, etc.)

- ✅ **Domain Layer**: Created Learning and Events bounded contexts
  - LearningModule, ModuleCompletion entities
  - LiveEvent, EventAttendance entities
  - Value objects for type safety
- ✅ **Infrastructure Layer**: Eloquent models and database
  - LearningModuleModel, LearningCompletionModel
  - LiveEventModel, EventRegistrationModel, EventAttendanceModel
  - Scopes and relationships
- ✅ **Application Layer**: Business logic services
  - LearningService with completion tracking
  - EventService with check-in/check-out
  - **CRITICAL**: Both services integrated with LgrActivityTrackingService
- ✅ **Presentation Layer**: Controllers and routes
  - LearningController (index, show, start, complete)
  - EventController (index, show, register, check-in, check-out)
  - Routes added to web.php under authenticated group
- ✅ **Database**: Migration with 5 tables
  - learning_modules (text-based, video support for later)
  - learning_completions (progress tracking)
  - live_events (webinars, workshops, meetings)
  - event_registrations (sign-ups)
  - event_attendances (check-in system)
- ✅ **Seeders**: Sample content created
  - 5 learning modules (Introduction, 7-Level System, LGR, Network Building, Financial Literacy)
  - 6 upcoming events (Orientation, Workshops, Q&A, Success Stories)
- ✅ **LGR Integration**: Activity tracking connected
  - `recordLearningActivity()` called on module completion
  - `recordEventAttendance()` called on event check-in
  - Members can now earn daily LGR credits through learning and events

**Status**: Backend implementation complete. Next: Vue components for member interface.
