## How It Works

### Login Process

1. **User enters identifier** (phone or email) in login field
2. **System detects type**:
   - Contains only digits/+/-/spaces → Phone number
   - Contains @ symbol → Email address
3. **Phone normalization** (if phone):
   - Removes spaces, dashes, parentheses
   - Converts `0977123456` → `+260977123456`
   - Converts `260977123456` → `+260977123456`
4. **Authentication** with appropriate credentials

### Supported Phone Formats

All these formats work:
- `0977123456` → Normalized to `+260977123456`
- `+260977123456` → Already normalized
- `260977123456` → Normalized to `+260977123456`
- `0 977 123 456` → Normalized to `+260977123456`
- `(097) 712-3456` → Normalized to `+260977123456`

```
Input: 0977123456
Password: ********
✅ Logs in successfully
```

### Login with Email
```

Password: ********
✅ Logs in successfully
```

### Registration
```

Password: ********
✅ Registers with normalized phone: +260977123456
```

## Testing

### Test Login with Phone
1. Register a user with phone: `0977123456`
2. Logout
3. Login with: `0977123456` → Should work
4. Login with: `+260977123456` → Should work
5. Login with: `0 977 123 456` → Should work

### Test Login with Email
1. Register a user with email: `test@example.com`
2. Logout
3. Login with: `test@example.com` → Should work

### Test Registration
1. Fill registration form with phone
2. Submit
3. Check database - phone should be normalized to `+260` format

## Database Schema

```sql
-- users table additions
phone VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE NULL
phone_verified_at TIMESTAMP NULL
```

---

## API Changes

### Registration Endpoint
**POST** `/register`

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "phone": "0977123456",
  "password": "password123",
  "password_confirmation": "password123"
}
```

### Login Endpoint
**POST** `/login`

```json
{
  "email": "0977123456",  // Can be phone or email
  "password": "password123",
  "remember": false
}
```

---

## User Model Methods

### Find User by Phone or Email
```php
$user = User::findByPhoneOrEmail('0977123456');
$user = User::findByPhoneOrEmail('user@example.com');
```

### Normalize Phone Number
```php
$normalized = User::normalizePhone('0977123456');
// Returns: +260977123456

$normalized = User::normalizePhone('+260 977 123 456');
// Returns: +260977123456
```

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 1 (Optional - Later)
- [ ] SMS OTP verification on registration
- [ ] Phone number verification flow
- [ ] "Verify Phone" button in profile

### Phase 2 (Optional - Later)
- [ ] SMS-based password reset
- [ ] Two-factor authentication via SMS
- [ ] Phone number change with verification

---

## Benefits

### For Users
- ✅ **Easier to remember** - Phone numbers are more memorable than emails
- ✅ **Faster login** - No need to remember which email was used
- ✅ **Familiar** - Everyone knows their phone number
- ✅ **Flexible** - Can use either phone or email

### For Platform
- ✅ **Better accessibility** - Reaches users without regular email access
- ✅ **Mobile money integration** - Phone numbers needed for MTN MoMo, Airtel Money
- ✅ **SMS notifications** - Can send SMS to verified phones
- ✅ **Reduced support** - Fewer "forgot email" support requests

---

## Security Considerations

### Implemented
- ✅ Phone numbers are unique (can't register same phone twice)
- ✅ Phone normalization prevents duplicate formats
- ✅ Rate limiting on login attempts
- ✅ Password hashing (bcrypt)

### Future (Optional)
- [ ] SMS OTP verification
- [ ] Phone number verification before allowing login
- [ ] Two-factor authentication

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Can't login with phone
**Solution:** Ensure phone is normalized in database. Check if phone was registered correctly.

### Issue: Phone already exists error
**Solution:** Phone numbers must be unique. User may have already registered with that number.

### Issue: Invalid phone format
**Solution:** System accepts most formats and normalizes them. If issues persist, check `normalizePhone()` method.
