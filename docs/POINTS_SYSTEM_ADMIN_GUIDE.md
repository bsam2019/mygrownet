## Troubleshooting

### User Not Qualifying

**Check**:

2. Recent transaction history
3. Last activity date
4. Any deductions or penalties

**Solutions**:
- Award missing points if system error
- Verify user completed required activities
- Check for any holds or flags

### Points Not Updating

**Check**:
1. Transaction was created successfully
2. User points record exists
3. No database errors in logs

**Solutions**:
- Refresh the page
- Check application logs
- Use "Set Points" to correct if needed

### Level Not Advancing

**Check**:
1. All requirements met (LP, time, referrals, courses, downline)
2. Level progress indicators
3. Recent level check job execution

**Solutions**:
- Run manual level check: `php artisan points:check-advancements`
- Use "Advance Level" if requirements are met but system didn't trigger
