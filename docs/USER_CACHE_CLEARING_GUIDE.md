# Clearing Browser Cache - User Guide

If you're seeing a white page or old content after logging in, your browser cache may need to be cleared.

## Quick Fix (Recommended)

### Hard Refresh
This clears the current page cache without clearing all your browser data:

**Windows/Linux:**
- Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (or `Ctrl + F5`)

**Mac:**
- Press `Cmd + Shift + R` (or `Cmd + Option + R`)

**Mobile (Chrome):**
- Tap the menu (⋮) → Settings → Privacy → Clear browsing data
- Select "Cached images and files"
- Tap "Clear data"

Clearing your cache:
- ✅ Removes old website files stored on your device
- ✅ Removes cookies (login sessions)
- ✅ Removes cached images and data
- ✅ Forces your browser to download fresh content
- ✅ Fixes white pages and loading errors
