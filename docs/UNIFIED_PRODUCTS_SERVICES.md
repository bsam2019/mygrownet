# MyGrowNet Products & Services - Unified System

**Version:** 3.0  
**Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Status:** Unified LP/BP Integration

---

## 1. Overview

MyGrowNet is a digital wealth and empowerment platform that combines investments, e-commerce, learning, and a referral-based income model within a compliant limited liability company structure. Members earn monthly income through **participation**, **learning**, **purchasing**, and **network growth**.

Every new member receives a **Welcome Package**, and their progress is tracked through **Life Points (LP)** and **Bonus Points (BP)** systems â€” the core of MyGrowNet's economic engine.

---

## 2. The Dual-Point Reward System

### 2.1. Life Points (LP)

**Purpose:** To track member growth, activity, and rank within the 3x7 matrix.

#### How LPs Work:

- Members receive **initial LPs** when they join
- Additional LPs accumulate through:
  - Successful referrals (direct and indirect)
  - Participation in training programs
  - Consistent monthly renewals
  - Achieving leadership milestones (e.g., helping 3 active members under them)
  
#### Impact:

LPs determine **rank** and **position eligibility** for higher-level bonuses or leadership benefits. They serve as the long-term measure of a member's *growth, stability, and trustworthiness* within the system â€” encouraging sustained participation, not just sign-ups.

**Key Characteristics:**
- âœ… Never expire or reset
- âœ… Accumulate forever
- âœ… Determine professional level (Associate â†’ Ambassador)
- âœ… Unlock leadership benefits and bonus tiers
- âœ… Measure long-term commitment and contribution

---

### 2.2. Bonus Points (BP)

**Purpose:** To calculate monthly cash bonuses and determine earnings from MyGrowNet's revenue-sharing system.

#### How BPs Are Earned:

- Recruiting new members
- Purchasing from **MyGrow Shop**
- Sharing or promoting partner sale links
- Attending or completing training programs
- Monthly subscription renewals
- Helping downline members activate accounts

#### Conversion Formula:

At month-end, total BPs accumulated by all members form the **Bonus Pool**. Each member's BP share determines their portion of the **60% investment revenue distribution** for that month.

```
Member Bonus = (Individual BP / Total BP) Ã— 60% of monthly profit
```

#### Impact:

Encourages consistent engagement, content sharing, and sales promotion while ensuring fairness â€” earnings are performance-based, not solely referral-based.

**Key Characteristics:**
- ðŸ”„ Reset to 0 on the 1st of each month
- ðŸ’° Directly determine monthly earnings
- ðŸ“Š Fair distribution based on contribution
- ðŸŽ¯ Reward active participation
- âš¡ Drive immediate engagement
