# Session Summary - October 27, 2025

## Issues Fixed & Features Implemented

### 1. ✅ Fixed Team Member Active Status Display
**Problem:** Esaya Nkhata showing as "Active" despite not having a starter kit

**Root Cause:** 
- `ReferralController` was using `hasActiveSubscription()` method instead of checking `has_starter_kit` flag
- Method was checking for verified payments instead of starter kit ownership

**Solution:**
- Updated `app/Http/Controllers/Referral/ReferralController.php` to check `has_starter_kit` flag
- Changed `is_active` logic: `$isActive = (bool) $member->has_starter_kit`
- Now correctly shows inactive for users without starter kits

**Files Modified:**
- `app/Http/Controllers/Referral/ReferralController.php`

---

### 2. ✅ Fixed Matrix Page Referral Display
**Problem:** Matrix page showing 0 referrals for Jason Mwale who has 8 referrals

**Root Causes:**
1. `referral_count` field was outdated (showing 0 instead of 8)
2. `getReferralStats()` was using cached field instead of counting actual referrals
3. `buildMatrixStructure()` was showing user himself instead of his referrals
4. `getMatrixDownlineCount()` only counting Level 1, not entire downline tree
5. Only 1 of 8 referrals had matrix positions created

**Solutions:**
1. **Updated `getReferralStats()` method** to count actual referrals:
   ```php
   'total_referrals' => $this->referrals()->count()
   'active_referrals' => $this->referrals()->where('has_starter_kit', true)->count()
   ```

2. **Created `UpdateReferralCounts` command** to sync cached counts:
   - Command: `php artisan referrals:update-counts`
   - Updated 14 users with correct referral counts

3. **Fixed `buildMatrixStructure()` method** to show actual referrals instead of user himself

4. **Fixed `getMatrixDownlineCount()` method** to properly count entire downline tree:
   - Level 1: Direct children
   - Level 2: Children of Level 1 members
   - Level 3: Children of Level 2 members

5. **Ran `matrix:initialize` command** to create matrix positions for 84 existing users

6. **Added automatic referral count increment** in `VerifyPaymentUseCase`:
   - Automatically increments sponsor's `referral_count` when payment verified

**Results:**
- Jason now shows 8 total referrals
- Matrix displays: Level 1: 3, Level 2: 8, Level 3: 4, Total: 15
- Level 1 shows his 3 direct matrix members (Esaya, Elizabeth, JAMES)
- Spillover working correctly (remaining 5 referrals in Level 2)

**Files Modified:**
- `app/Models/User.php` (getReferralStats, buildMatrixStructure, getMatrixDownlineCount)
- `app/Console/Commands/UpdateReferralCounts.php` (new)
- `app/Application/Payment/UseCases/VerifyPaymentUseCase.php`
