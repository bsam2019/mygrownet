# MyGrowNet Wallet - Member Guide

**Simple Guide to Your Digital Wallet**

---

## What is the MyGrowNet Wallet?

Think of your MyGrowNet Wallet like a **digital purse** that lives inside the MyGrowNet platform. It's a safe place to:
- 💰 Store your earnings (commissions, bonuses, profit-sharing)
- 🛒 Buy products and subscriptions
- 📚 Pay for training and workshops
- 💳 Make quick payments without entering card details every time

---

## Important: What the Wallet is NOT

❌ **NOT a bank account** - It's a platform feature, not a bank  
❌ **NOT an investment** - Your money doesn't earn interest  
❌ **NOT for money transfers** - You can't send money to friends  
❌ **NOT a loan service** - No borrowing or lending  

✅ **It IS a convenient way** to manage your MyGrowNet funds!
