# Workshop Management System - Implementation Complete

## Overview

A complete Domain-Driven Design (DDD) workshop management system for MyGrowNet platform that handles workshop catalog, registration, payment, attendance tracking, and automatic LP/BP rewards.

## Architecture

### Domain Layer (`app/Domain/Workshop/`)

- **Use Cases**:
  - `RegisterForWorkshopUseCase` - Handles workshop registration
  - `CompleteWorkshopUseCase` - Marks completion and awards points

### Infrastructure Layer (`app/Infrastructure/Persistence/`)
- **Eloquent Models**: `WorkshopModel`, `WorkshopRegistrationModel`, `WorkshopSessionModel`, `WorkshopAttendanceModel`
- **Repository Implementations**: Concrete implementations

### Presentation Layer
- **Controllers**: `MyGrowNet\WorkshopController`
- **Vue Pages**: Workshop catalog and detail pages

- Uses existing `PointsService`
- Source: 'workshop_completion'
- Prevents duplicate awards

### 3. User System
- Links to User model
- Tracks user registrations
- Registration history

## Business Rules

1. **Registration Rules**
   - Must be published to accept registrations
   - Cannot register if workshop is full
   - Cannot register twice for same workshop
   - Registration closes when workshop starts

2. **Capacity Management**
   - Optional max_participants limit
   - Real-time slot availability
   - Full workshops cannot accept new registrations

3. **Completion Requirements**
   - Must be registered to complete
   - Points awarded only once
   - Certificate issued only for completed workshops

4. **Payment Requirements**
   - Registration requires payment
   - Payment must be verified by admin
   - Confirmed payment changes status to 'registered'

## Workflow Example

6. Attend workshop → Mark attended
7. Complete workshop → Automatic LP/BP award + certificate

### Admin Journey:
