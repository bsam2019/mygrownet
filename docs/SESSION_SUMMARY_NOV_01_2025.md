### 5. Notification System Integration ‚úÖ

**Issue Fixed**: Starter kit purchase notifications were not being sent

**Root Cause**: 
- Notification service was being instantiated with `app()` helper inside the method
- This pattern was inconsistent with other services using dependency injection

**Solution**:
- Added `SendNotificationUseCase` as constructor dependency
- Updated `sendPurchaseNotification()` to use injected service
- Changed hardcoded route to use `route()` helper for proper URL generation

**Files Updated**:
- `app/Services/StarterKitService.php`
  - Added constructor with notification service injection
  - Updated notification method to use `$this->notificationService`
  - Fixed action URL to use `route('mygrownet.starter-kit.show')`

**Notification Details**:
- Type: `starter_kit.purchased`
- Title: "üéâ Starter Kit Activated!"
- Includes tier name, shop credit amount
- Premium tier gets additional LGR qualification message
- Action button links to starter kit page

## üîß Technical Details

### Database Schema

**starter_kit_purchases**:
```sql
- tier ENUM('basic', 'premium') DEFAULT 'basic'
```

**users**:
```sql
- starter_kit_tier ENUM('basic', 'premium') NULLABLE
```

### Service Layer

**StarterKitService**:
```php
const TIER_BASIC = 'basic';
const TIER_PREMIUM = 'premium';
const PRICE_BASIC = 500.00;
const PRICE_PREMIUM = 1000.00;
const SHOP_CREDIT_BASIC = 100.00;
const SHOP_CREDIT_PREMIUM = 200.00;
```

**LgrQualificationService**:
```php
// Only premium tier qualifies
if ($user->starter_kit_tier !== 'premium') {
    return ['qualified' => false, 'reason' => 'LGR is only available for Premium Starter Kit members'];
}
```

### Payment Verification

**VerifyPaymentUseCase**:
```php
// Recognizes both K500 and K1000
$amount = $payment->amount()->value();
$isStarterKitPayment = $paymentType === 'product' && ($amount == 500 || $amount == 1000);

// Auto-detects tier
$tier = $amount == 1000 ? 'premium' : 'basic';
```
