## How Upgrades Work

### Scenario: Member Upgrades from Associate to Professional

**Current Status:**
- Level: Associate
- Monthly subscription: K100
- Already paid for current month

**Upgrade Process:**
1. Member qualifies for Professional (earned enough LP)
2. Member clicks "Upgrade to Professional"
3. System charges **K50** (difference between K150 and K100)
4. Member immediately gets Professional benefits
5. Next month: Member pays full **K150**

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Fair to member (no double payment)
- ✅ Immediate benefit unlock
- ✅ Simple calculation
- ✅ Encourages upgrades

---

## Why NO Annual Subscriptions?

### Problems with Annual Subscriptions:

1. **Upgrade Complexity**
   - What if member upgrades mid-year?
   - How to calculate refund/credit?
   - Complex commission calculations

2. **Cash Flow Issues**
   - Large upfront payment
   - Irregular revenue stream
   - Harder to forecast

3. **Commission Distribution**
   - How to split annual payment across 12 months?
   - Upline gets large commission upfront
   - Unfair to later referrals

4. **Member Flexibility**
   - Locked into level for a year
   - Can't easily downgrade if needed
   - Higher barrier to entry

### Benefits of Monthly-Only:

1. ✅ **Simple Upgrades** - Pay difference anytime
2. ✅ **Consistent Cash Flow** - Predictable monthly revenue
3. ✅ **Fair Commissions** - Monthly distribution
4. ✅ **Member Flexibility** - Can adjust level monthly
5. ✅ **Lower Barrier** - Smaller monthly commitment

**Default**: 1 BP = K0.50

## Member Upgrade Flow

### Step 1: Check Eligibility

if ($user->life_points >= $nextLevel->lp_requirement) {
    // Show upgrade button
}
```

### Step 2: Calculate Upgrade Fee
```php
$currentSubscription = $user->current_subscription_price; // K100
$nextSubscription = $nextLevel->subscription_price; // K150
$upgradeFee = $nextSubscription - $currentSubscription; // K50
```

### Step 3: Process Upgrade
```php
// Charge upgrade fee
$payment = processPayment($upgradeFee);

// Update user level
$user->update([
    'professional_level' => $nextLevel->name,
    'subscription_price' => $nextSubscription,
    'upgraded_at' => now(),
]);

// Award upgrade bonus BP
awardBP($user, 'level_upgrade', 100);
```

### Step 4: Next Month Billing
```php
// On next billing cycle
$user->charge($nextSubscription); // K150
```

## Commission Calculation with Upgrades

### Example: Upline Earns from Downline Upgrade

**Scenario:**
- You (Professional) referred John (Associate)
- John upgrades to Professional mid-month
- John pays K50 upgrade fee

**Your Commission:**
- Upgrade fee: K50 × 15% = K7.50 (one-time)
- Next month: K150 × 15% = K22.50 (recurring)

**Benefits:**
- ✅ You earn from upgrade
- ✅ Higher recurring commission
- ✅ Incentive to help downline grow
