# MyGrowNet Points System - Member Guide

**Welcome to Your Growth Journey!**

This guide explains how you earn points, advance through professional levels, and qualify for earnings on the MyGrowNet platform.

## 🎯 What Are Points?

MyGrowNet uses two types of points to reward your activity and growth:

### 🏆 Lifetime Points (LP)
- **What they do**: Help you advance through professional levels (Associate → Ambassador)
- **How long they last**: Forever! They never expire
- **Why they matter**: Higher levels = better commissions and profit-sharing multipliers

### ⚡ Monthly Activity Points (MAP)
- **What they do**: Qualify you to receive your monthly earnings
- **How long they last**: Reset to zero on the 1st of each month
- **Why they matter**: You must earn enough MAP each month to get paid

**Think of it this way:**
- **LP** = Your career progression (long-term)
- **MAP** = Your monthly work requirement (short-term)
