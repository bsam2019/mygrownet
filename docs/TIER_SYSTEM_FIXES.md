# Two-Tier Starter Kit System - Bug Fixes

**Date**: November 1, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Fixed

---

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Undefined Constant Error ✅

**Error**: `Undefined constant App\Services\StarterKitService::SHOP_CREDIT`

**Root Cause**: 
- Old `SHOP_CREDIT` constant was removed in favor of `SHOP_CREDIT_BASIC` and `SHOP_CREDIT_PREMIUM`
- `MyGrowNet\StarterKitController` was still referencing the old constant

**Files Fixed**:
- `app/Http/Controllers/MyGrowNet/StarterKitController.php`

**Changes Made**:
```php
// Before (caused error)
'shopCredit' => StarterKitService::SHOP_CREDIT,

// After (fixed)
'tiers' => [
    'basic' => [
        'price' => StarterKitService::PRICE_BASIC,
        'shopCredit' => StarterKitService::SHOP_CREDIT_BASIC,
    ],
    'premium' => [
        'price' => StarterKitService::PRICE_PREMIUM,
        'shopCredit' => StarterKitService::SHOP_CREDIT_PREMIUM,
    ],
],
```

### 2. K1000 Payments Not Recognized as Active Members ✅

**Issue**: 
- System only recognized K500 payments as starter kit purchases
- K1000 (Premium tier) payments were not activating members

**Root Cause**:
- `VerifyPaymentUseCase` had hardcoded check for `amount == 500`
- Did not account for premium tier (K1000)

**Files Fixed**:
- `app/Application/Payment/UseCases/VerifyPaymentUseCase.php`

**Changes Made**:

1. **Payment Amount Check**:
```php
// Before (only K500)
if ($paymentType === 'product' && $payment->amount()->value() == 500 && !$user->has_starter_kit)

// After (K500 or K1000)
$amount = $payment->amount()->value();
$isStarterKitPayment = $paymentType === 'product' && ($amount == 500 || $amount == 1000) && !$user->has_starter_kit;

if ($isStarterKitPayment)
```

2. **Tier Detection**:
```php
// Determine tier based on payment amount
$amount = $payment->amount()->value();
$tier = $amount == 1000 ? 'premium' : 'basic';

// Create purchase with correct tier
$purchase = StarterKitPurchaseModel::create([
    'user_id' => $user->id,
    'tier' => $tier,  // ← Now includes tier
    'amount' => $amount,  // ← Uses actual amount (500 or 1000)
    // ...
]);
```

### 3. Missing Tier Parameter in Controllers ✅

**Issue**: Controllers were not passing tier parameter to services

**Files Fixed**:
- `app/Http/Controllers/MyGrowNet/StarterKitController.php`
- `app/Application/StarterKit/UseCases/PurchaseStarterKitUseCase.php`

**Changes Made**:

1. **Controller Validation**:
```php
$validated = $request->validate([
    'tier' => 'required|string|in:basic,premium',  // ← Added
    'payment_method' => 'required|string|in:mobile_money,bank_transfer,wallet',
    'terms_accepted' => 'required|accepted',
]);
```

2. **UseCase Execution**:
```php
$result = $this->purchaseUseCase->execute(
    $user,
    $validated['payment_method'],
    null,
    $validated['tier']  // ← Added tier parameter
);
```

3. **UseCase Method Signature**:
```php
public function execute(
    User $user,
    string $paymentMethod,
    ?string $paymentReference = null,
    string $tier = 'basic'  // ← Added with default
): array
```

## Testing Verification

### Test 1: Basic Tier Purchase (K500)
```bash
✅ Payment amount: K500
✅ Tier detected: basic
✅ Shop credit: K100
✅ LGR multiplier: 1.0x
✅ User activated: Yes
✅ Has starter kit: Yes
```

### Test 2: Premium Tier Purchase (K1000)
```bash
✅ Payment amount: K1000
✅ Tier detected: premium
✅ Shop credit: K200
✅ LGR multiplier: 1.5x
✅ User activated: Yes
✅ Has starter kit: Yes
```

### Test 3: Payment Verification
```bash
✅ K500 payment verified → Basic tier activated
✅ K1000 payment verified → Premium tier activated
✅ Correct shop credit applied
✅ LGR qualification updated
✅ Matrix position created
```

## Active Member Recognition

### How It Works Now

**Payment Verification Flow**:
```
Admin verifies payment (K500 or K1000)
         ↓
System detects amount
         ↓
Determines tier (500 = basic, 1000 = premium)
         ↓
Creates StarterKitPurchase with tier
         ↓
Calls completePurchase()
         ↓
User activated with:
  - has_starter_kit = true
  - starter_kit_tier = 'basic' or 'premium'
  - Shop credit (K100 or K200)
  - LGR qualification (1.0x or 1.5x)
  - Matrix position
  - status = 'active'
```

**Active Member Criteria**:
- ✅ Payment verified (K500 or K1000)
- ✅ `has_starter_kit = true`
- ✅ `status = 'active'`
- ✅ Matrix position created
- ✅ LGR qualification updated

---

## Backward Compatibility

### Existing K500 Members
- ✅ Automatically treated as Basic tier
- ✅ No data migration needed
- ✅ Existing shop credits preserved
- ✅ LGR points remain valid

### New Members
- ✅ Can choose Basic (K500) or Premium (K1000)
- ✅ Tier stored in database
- ✅ Correct benefits applied
- ✅ LGR multiplier active immediately

---

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Features (Not Implemented)
1. **Tier Upgrade**
   - Allow Basic → Premium upgrade
   - Pay K500 difference
   - Retroactive LGR point adjustment

2. **Tier Analytics**
   - Track conversion rates
   - Compare tier performance
   - ROI analysis

3. **Tier-Specific Content**
   - Exclusive premium content
   - Early access features
   - Premium-only webinars

## Conclusion

All issues resolved. The two-tier starter kit system now:
- ✅ Works without errors
