## The 3×3 Matrix: How Your Network Grows

### What is a 3×3 Matrix?

Think of it like a family tree, but for your community:

```
                    YOU
                   / | \
                  /  |  \
              Person Person Person  ← Level 1 (3 people)
              / | \  / | \  / | \
             3  3  3 3  3  3 3  3  3  ← Level 2 (9 people)
            And so on for 7 levels...
```

### How It Works:

1. **You invite 3 people** (your direct referrals)
2. **They each invite 3 people** (your Level 2)
3. **Those people invite 3 more** (your Level 3)
4. This continues for **7 levels deep**

### The Magic of Spillover:

If you invite more than 3 people, the extras automatically go under your existing team members. This means:
- **You help your team grow** even when you're not actively recruiting
- **Your team helps each other** through spillover
- **Everyone benefits** from the community's growth

### Your Potential Network:

| Level | Name | People | What It Means |
|-------|------|--------|---------------|
| 1 | **Associate** | 3 | Your direct referrals |
| 2 | **Professional** | 9 | Their referrals |
| 3 | **Senior** | 27 | Growing network |
| 4 | **Manager** | 81 | Leading a team |
| 5 | **Director** | 243 | Strategic growth |
| 6 | **Executive** | 729 | Top performance |
| 7 | **Ambassador** | 2,187 | Community impact |

**Total: Up to 3,279 people in your network!**

As your network grows through these levels, you progress from **Associate** (just starting) to **Ambassador** (community leader).

- This is your immediate reward for sharing MyGrowNet

**Example:** If the bonus is K50 per referral, and you invite 3 people, you earn K150.

### 2. Level Commissions (Network Income)

You earn bonuses from all 7 levels of your network as you progress:

**Level Progression:**
- **Associate (Level 1)**: Your 3 direct referrals - Highest commission
- **Professional (Level 2)**: Their 9 referrals - Good commission
- **Senior (Level 3)**: 27 people - Building income
- **Manager (Level 4)**: 81 people - Team leadership bonus
- **Director (Level 5)**: 243 people - Strategic income
- **Executive (Level 6)**: 729 people - Top performer bonus
- **Ambassador (Level 7)**: 2,187 people - Community impact bonus

**The Power of Depth:**

### 3. Milestone Rewards

- **Network of 50**: Recognition gift
- **Network of 100**: Gadget or cash prize

### 4. Booster Fund

When you reach leadership levels:
- Qualify for **business startup capital**
- Use it to start or grow a business
- Get ongoing mentorship and support

### 5. Profit-Sharing (Passive Income!)

**This is BIG!** All active members receive quarterly profit distributions from MyGrowNet's business investments:

**How It Works:**
- MyGrowNet invests in community projects (farms, businesses, real estate)
- When these projects make profit, **60% goes to members**
- You get paid **just for being an active member**
- No extra investment needed!

**Distribution:**
- **50% split equally** - Everyone gets the same base amount
- **50% by level** - Higher levels (Manager, Director, Executive, Ambassador) get more

**Example:** If projects make K100,000 profit this quarter:
- K60,000 goes to members
- If you're an Associate with 1,000 active members: You get K30 equal share + K15 level share = **K45**
- If you're an Ambassador: You get K30 equal share + K150 level share = **K180**

**This means you earn even when you're not actively recruiting!**

### 6. Community Leadership Prizes

Top performers receive:
- **Monthly prizes** for best recruiters
- **Quarterly awards** for best mentors
