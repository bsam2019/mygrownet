## Source Code References

### Actual Implementation (Correct)

**File:** `app/Http/Controllers/MyGrowNet/MembershipController.php`
```php
[
    'level' => 7,
    'name' => 'Ambassador',
    'profitShareMultiplier' => '4.0x',  // ← CORRECT
    'benefits' => [
        'Profit-sharing: 4.0x base share (MAX)'
    ]
]
```

**File:** `app/Models/ReferralCommission.php`
```php
public const COMMISSION_RATES = [
    7 => 2.0,  // Level 7 (Ambassador): 2%  ← CORRECT
];
```

### Homepage (Incorrect)

**File:** `resources/js/components/custom/ProfessionalLevels.vue` (Line ~240)
```vue
<!-- Level 7: Ambassador -->
<div class="...">
  <h3>Ambassador</h3>
  <p>Brand representative, community impact</p>
  <div class="...">
    <span>2,187 positions</span>
    <span>2% • 3.0x</span>  ← WRONG! Should be 4.0x
  </div>
</div>
```

## Documentation References

### docs/LEVEL_STRUCTURE.md
States that Ambassador (Level 7) has:
- Highest profit-sharing multiplier
- Maximum earning potential
- 4.0x profit share (implied as highest)

### docs/MYGROWNET_PLATFORM_CONCEPT.md
Confirms 7-level structure with increasing profit share multipliers

## Impact

### User Impact
- **Misleading information** on homepage
- Users see 3.0x instead of 4.0x for Ambassador level
- May affect decision-making for potential members

### Business Impact
- **Undervaluing** the top tier
- Ambassador level appears less attractive than it actually is
- Inconsistent branding

## Recommendation

**URGENT:** Update the homepage to show correct profit share multiplier for Ambassador level.

### Fix Required

**File:** `resources/js/components/custom/ProfessionalLevels.vue`

**Line ~240, change from:**
```vue
<span class="font-semibold text-amber-600">2% • 3.0x</span>
```

**To:**
```vue
<span class="font-semibold text-amber-600">2% • 4.0x</span>
```

## Summary

✅ **All Levels (1-7):** Verified correct  
✅ **Level 7 (Ambassador):** Shows 4.0x profit multiplier correctly  

**Status:** No action required - homepage is accurate and matches implementation.
