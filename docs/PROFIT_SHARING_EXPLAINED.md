## What Makes MyGrowNet Different?

Unlike traditional MLMs that only pay commissions on recruitment, MyGrowNet offers **direct profit-sharing** from company investments. This means you earn passive income just by being an active member, regardless of your network size!

---

## How It Works (Simple Explanation)

### Step 1: MyGrowNet Invests
The company takes a portion of revenue and invests in **real, profitable businesses**:
- Agricultural farms
- Manufacturing companies
- Service businesses
- Real estate properties
- Community enterprises

### Step 2: Businesses Make Profits
These investments generate actual profits from:
- Product sales
- Service fees
- Rental income
- Business operations

### Step 3: Profits Are Shared
**60% of all profits** are distributed to active members every quarter.  
**40%** is retained for company operations, growth, and reserves.

### Step 4: You Get Paid
Every 3 months, you receive your share directly to your account!

---

## Who Qualifies?

### Active Member Definition

You qualify for profit-sharing if you are an **active member**:

✅ **Current subscription paid** - Your monthly/annual subscription is up to date  
✅ **Platform engagement** - You've logged in within the last 30 days  
✅ **Account in good standing** - No violations or suspensions

**That's it!** You don't need to recruit anyone or have a large network to receive profit-sharing.

---

## How Much Do You Get?

### The Formula

Your profit share depends on your **professional level**. Higher levels receive larger shares.

**Base Share Calculation:**
```
Total Profit Pool ÷ Total Weighted Shares = Base Share
Your Share = Base Share × Your Level Multiplier
```

### Level Multipliers

| Level | Name | Multiplier | Example Share* |
|-------|------|------------|----------------|
| 1 | Associate | 1.0x | K100 |
| 2 | Professional | 1.2x | K120 |
| 3 | Senior | 1.5x | K150 |
| 4 | Manager | 2.0x | K200 |
| 5 | Director | 2.5x | K250 |
| 6 | Executive | 3.0x | K300 |
| 7 | Ambassador | 4.0x | K400 |

*Based on K100 base share (example only)

## Real-World Example

### Scenario: Quarterly Distribution

**Company Investments:**
- Farm producing vegetables: K50,000 profit
- Manufacturing workshop: K30,000 profit
- Rental properties: K20,000 profit
- **Total Quarterly Profit: K100,000**

**Distribution:**
- 60% to members: K60,000
- 40% to company: K40,000

**Active Members: 1,000**

**Calculating Weighted Shares:**
- 300 Associates (1.0x) = 300 shares
- 250 Professionals (1.2x) = 300 shares
- 200 Seniors (1.5x) = 300 shares
- 150 Managers (2.0x) = 300 shares
- 70 Directors (2.5x) = 175 shares
- 25 Executives (3.0x) = 75 shares
- 5 Ambassadors (4.0x) = 20 shares
- **Total Weighted Shares: 1,470**

**Base Share:**
K60,000 ÷ 1,470 = K40.82 per share

**Individual Payouts:**
- Associate: K40.82 × 1.0 = **K40.82**
- Professional: K40.82 × 1.2 = **K48.98**
- Senior: K40.82 × 1.5 = **K61.23**
- Manager: K40.82 × 2.0 = **K81.64**
- Director: K40.82 × 2.5 = **K102.05**
- Executive: K40.82 × 3.0 = **K122.46**
- Ambassador: K40.82 × 4.0 = **K163.28**

### Q: What if I just joined?

### Q: Can I lose my profit share?

### Q: Does my network size affect profit-sharing?
A: No! Profit-sharing is based solely on your professional level, not network size.

## Comparison: Profit-Sharing vs Commissions

### Commissions (Network-Based)
- Requires building a network
- Based on referrals and subscriptions
- Active income (requires ongoing effort)
- Unlimited potential
- Immediate rewards

### Profit-Sharing (Passive)
- No network required
- Based on company investments
- Passive income (automatic)
- Limited by investment performance
- Quarterly distributions

### Combined Power
MyGrowNet members earn from **BOTH**:
- Build your network → Earn commissions
- Stay active → Earn profit-sharing
- Advance levels → Increase both income streams!
