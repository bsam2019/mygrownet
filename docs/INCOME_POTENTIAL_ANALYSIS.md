## Additional Income Streams

### 1. Registration Commissions (K500 one-time)

When your network members register new people, you earn commissions on the K500 registration fee:

**Example with 3 Direct Referrals:**
- Level 1: 3 × (K500 × 15%) = K225 one-time

**Example with Full Level 1 (12 members):**
- Level 1: 3 × K75 = K225
- Level 2: 9 × K50 = K450
- **Total**: K675 one-time

### 2. Profit-Sharing (Quarterly)

All active members receive quarterly profit distributions from MyGrowNet's community projects:

**Distribution Formula:**
- 60% of project profits go to members
- 50% equal share + 50% weighted by professional level

**Example**: If quarterly profit is K100,000:
- K60,000 distributed to members
- K30,000 equal share (divided among all active members)
- K30,000 weighted share (higher levels get more)

**Your Share Multiplier by Level:**
- Associate: 1.0x
- Professional: 1.2x
- Senior: 1.5x
- Manager: 2.0x
- Director: 2.5x
- Executive: 3.0x
- Ambassador: 3.5x

### 3. Bonus Points (BP) System

Monthly earnings also depend on Bonus Points (BP) accumulated through:
- Recruiting new members
- Product purchases from MyGrow Shop
- Course completions
- Workshop attendance
- Helping downline members activate

**Monthly Bonus Formula:**
```
Your Bonus = (Your BP / Total BP) × 60% of monthly profit
```
