## Overview

This document presents the consolidated redesign of MyGrowNet's reward system:
- **Starter Kits**: 4 tiers (K300 - K2,000) with real digital products
- **LGR (Daily Growth Reward)**: Activity-based daily rewards with time-bound cycles

---

## 1. Core Principles

### 1.1 Legal Compliance
- MyGrowNet is **NOT an investment scheme**
- All rewards backed by:
  - Product sales (books & tools)
  - Platform revenue
  - Verified member activity
- No fixed or guaranteed returns
- No requirement to recruit to earn

### 1.2 Reward Philosophy
Rewards are:
- **Time-bound**: LGR cycles have expiration dates
- **Activity-based**: Must complete activities to earn
- **Tier-weighted**: Higher tiers get better multipliers
- **Revenue-backed**: All payouts from actual revenue pools

---

## 2. Starter Kit Content Policy

### 2.1 Digital Products Only
Starter kits contain **only digital products** - no physical goods, no cash value promises.

### 2.2 Digital Books
- Personal development
- Financial literacy
- Small business basics

Tools designed for **ordinary users**, not just businesses:

**Important:** No internal MLM dashboards or back-office tools are used as starter kit value.

## 4. Starter Kit Payment Split

Each starter kit payment is automatically divided as follows:

| Allocation | Percentage | Purpose |
|------------|------------|---------|
| **LGR Pool** | 30% | Funds daily growth rewards |
| **Referral Bonus Pool** | 20% | Funds 7-level MLM commissions |
| **Company Revenue** | 50% | Operations, content, platform |

**Important Note on Commissions:**
- Commissions are calculated on **50% of the purchase amount** (not from the 20% pool)
- The 7-level rates (15%, 10%, 8%, 6%, 4%, 3%, 2% = 48%) apply to this 50% base
- Total commission payout = 24% of purchase price (48% of 50%)
- The 20% Referral Pool is used to fund these commission payouts

### Example (K300 Lite Pack):
- K90 → LGR Pool (30%)
- K60 → Referral Bonus Pool (20%)
- K150 → Company (50%)
- **Commission Base:** K150 (50% of K300)
- **Total Commissions:** K72 (48% of K150 = 24% of K300)

### Example (K500 Basic Pack):
- K150 → LGR Pool (30%)
- K100 → Referral Bonus Pool (20%)
- K250 → Company (50%)
- **Commission Base:** K250 (50% of K500)
- **Total Commissions:** K120 (48% of K250 = 24% of K500)

### Example (K1,000 Growth Plus Pack):
- K300 → LGR Pool (30%)
- K200 → Referral Bonus Pool (20%)
- K500 → Company (50%)
- **Commission Base:** K500 (50% of K1,000)
- **Total Commissions:** K240 (48% of K500 = 24% of K1,000)

### Example (K2,000 Pro Pack):
- K600 → LGR Pool (30%)
- K400 → Referral Bonus Pool (20%)
- K1,000 → Company (50%)
- **Commission Base:** K1,000 (50% of K2,000)
- **Total Commissions:** K480 (48% of K1,000 = 24% of K2,000)

**Key Points:**
- Commission base = 50% of purchase price
- 7-level commission rates apply to this 50% base
- Actual commission payout = 24% of purchase price
- 20% Referral Pool + company contribution covers commission payouts
- System is sustainable since not all members have full 7-level networks

---

## 5. Daily Growth Reward (LGR)

### 5.1 What is LGR?
LGR (Daily Growth Reward) is a **daily reward for verified activity**, funded from the LGR Pool (30% of starter kit sales).

**Not an investment return** - it's an activity-based reward for using purchased digital products.

### 5.2 Eligibility Requirements
To earn LGR on any given day, a member must:
1. Have an **active LGR cycle** (not expired)
2. **Log in** to the platform
3. **Complete at least one approved activity**

### 5.3 Approved Activities

| Activity | BP Earned |
|----------|-----------|
| Read book section | 2 BP |
| Use any tool | 2 BP |
| Complete daily task | 3 BP |
| Finish short lesson | 3 BP |
| Submit progress log | 4 BP |
| Complete course module | 5 BP |
| Refer active member | 10 BP |

### 5.4 LGR Calculation Formula

```
Member Daily LGR = (Member Daily BP × Tier Multiplier) ÷ Total Daily Weighted BP × Daily LGR Pool
```

**Where:**
- **Member Daily BP** = BP earned from activities that day
- **Tier Multiplier** = 0.5x, 1.0x, 1.5x, or 2.5x (based on starter kit tier)
- **Total Daily Weighted BP** = Sum of all members' (Daily BP × Tier Multiplier)
- **Daily LGR Pool** = Available LGR funds for that day

**LGR is credited as BP**, then reflected in wallet per conversion rules.

### 5.5 Daily Caps
Each tier has a maximum daily LGR cap to protect system sustainability:

| Tier | Max Daily LGR |
|------|---------------|
| Lite | K5 |
| Basic | K10 |
| Growth Plus | K20 |
| Pro | K40 |

---

## 6. LGR Cycle & Renewal Model

### 6.1 Time-Bound Cycles
LGR runs only for a **defined number of days** per tier:

| Tier | LGR Cycle Duration |
|------|-------------------|
| Lite | 30 days |
| Basic | 50 days |
| Growth Plus | 70 days |
| Pro | 90 days |

**When cycle ends:**
- Daily LGR stops
- LP, BP, referrals remain intact
- Member can renew or upgrade

### 6.2 Renewal Options

**Option 1: Starter Kit Renewal**
- Renew same tier or upgrade to higher tier
- Full new cycle activated
- Fees: See renewal fee table below

**Option 2: Activity-Based Renewal**
- Requires high activity completion (e.g., 80% of days active)
- Renewal fee: 20-30% of original kit price
- Rewards consistent members

**Option 3: Upgrade Renewal**
- Upgrade to higher tier
- Remaining cycle value converted proportionally
- Pay difference + small upgrade fee

### 6.3 Renewal Fees (Guide)

| Tier | Standard Renewal | Activity-Based Renewal |
|------|------------------|----------------------|
| Lite | K100 | K60-90 |
| Basic | K150 | K100-150 |
| Growth Plus | K300 | K200-300 |
| Pro | K500 | K400-600 |

### 6.4 Grace Period
- **7-day grace period** after cycle ends
- Can renew without losing consistency benefits
- After grace period, must purchase new starter kit

---

## 7. MLM Referral Bonus Structure

### 7.1 7-Level Commission Rates (Current System)

**Total Payout: 48%** (maintained from current implementation)

| Level | Name | Rate | Network Size |
|-------|------|------|--------------|
| 1 | Associate | 15% | 3 direct |
| 2 | Professional | 10% | 9 people |
| 3 | Senior | 8% | 27 people |
| 4 | Manager | 6% | 81 people |
| 5 | Director | 4% | 243 people |
| 6 | Executive | 3% | 729 people |
| 7 | Ambassador | 2% | 2,187 people |

**Total Payout:** 48%

**Note:** These rates remain unchanged from the current system. All commissions are paid from the Referral Bonus Pool (20% of starter kit sales).

### 7.2 Commission Base
- Commission base = **50% of starter kit price**
- Lite (K300): Commissions calculated on K150 (50%)
- Basic (K500): Commissions calculated on K250 (50%)
- Growth Plus (K1,000): Commissions calculated on K500 (50%)
- Pro (K2,000): Commissions calculated on K1,000 (50%)

**Important:** The 7-level rates apply to this 50% base, resulting in total commission payout of 24% of purchase price.

### 7.3 Starter Kit Gating Rules (Softer Approach)

**Members WITH Starter Kit:**
- Receive **100% of commission rates**
- Paid immediately as BP
- Full access to all levels
- Can withdraw earnings

**Members WITHOUT Starter Kit:**
- Receive **50% of commission rates**
- Held as BP (not withdrawable until activation)
- Released when starter kit purchased
- Encourages activation without completely blocking earnings

**Key Improvement:** Unlike the old system (0% without kit), members now earn 50% even before purchasing, reducing barriers to entry.

### 7.4 Payment Source
- All commissions paid from **Referral Bonus Pool (20%) + company contribution**
- Commission base = 50% of purchase price
- Total commission payout = 24% of purchase price (48% of 50% base)
- 20% pool + 4% company contribution = 24% total funding
- Sustainable and transparent
- Pool balance monitored daily

### 7.5 Commission Calculation Examples

**Example 1: Basic Pack (K500) - Full Network**
- **Commission Base:** K250 (50% of K500)
- Level 1 (15% of K250): K37.50
- Level 2 (10% of K250): K25.00
- Level 3 (8% of K250): K20.00
- Level 4 (6% of K250): K15.00
- Level 5 (4% of K250): K10.00
- Level 6 (3% of K250): K7.50
- Level 7 (2% of K250): K5.00
- **Total:** K120 (24% of K500)

**Example 2: Pro Pack (K2,000) - Full Network**
- **Commission Base:** K1,000 (50% of K2,000)
- Level 1 (15% of K1,000): K150
- Level 2 (10% of K1,000): K100
- Level 3 (8% of K1,000): K80
- Level 4 (6% of K1,000): K60
- Level 5 (4% of K1,000): K40
- Level 6 (3% of K1,000): K30
- Level 7 (2% of K1,000): K20
- **Total:** K480 (24% of K2,000)

## 8. Points System (Simplified)

### 8.1 Life Points (LP)
**Purpose:** Professional level progression

**Earned from:**
- Starter kit purchases (15-120 LP)
- Book and course completion (10-50 LP per item)
- Leadership milestones (50-200 LP)
- Team achievements (25-100 LP)

**Characteristics:**
- Never expire
- Accumulate forever
- Determine professional level
- Required for level advancement

### 8.2 Bonus Points (BP)
**Purpose:** Earnings and rewards

**Earned from:**
- Referral commissions (converted at K2 per BP)
- LGR daily activities (2-10 BP per activity)
- Team bonuses (variable)
- Monthly challenges (50-200 BP)

**Characteristics:**
- Reset to 0 at start of each month (no rollover)
- Used for bonus pool distribution
- Converted to wallet balance
- Determine monthly earnings share

### 8.3 Monthly BP Requirements (Simplified)

| Level | BP Required | Typical Path to Achieve |
|-------|-------------|------------------------|
| Associate | 50 | 10 daily logins + 1 activity |
| Professional | 100 | Daily logins + 1 course |
| Senior | 150 | Daily logins + 1 course + K200 sales |
| Manager | 200 | Daily logins + 2 courses + K300 sales |
| Director | 250 | Daily logins + 2 courses + K400 sales |
| Executive | 300 | Daily logins + 3 courses + K500 sales |
| Ambassador | 400 | Daily logins + 3 courses + K600 sales |

**Consequence of not meeting:** No monthly bonus pool distribution

**Key Improvement:** Requirements reduced by 50% compared to previous system (was 100-800 BP), making qualification much more achievable.

**Monthly Reset:** BP resets to 0 on the 1st of each month. Members start fresh each month.

**Assumptions:**
- 1,000 active members
- Average tier: Basic (K500)
- 50% renewal rate after cycle ends

**Monthly Revenue:**
- New purchases: 200 × K500 = K100,000

- **Total:** K160,000/month

**Monthly Payouts:**
- LGR Pool (30%): K48,000
- Referral Pool (20%): K32,000

| **Cycle Length** | Fixed 70 days | Variable (30-90 days) |
| **Daily Rate** | Fixed K25/day | Pool-based, activity-weighted |
| **Multiplier** | None | 0.5x - 2.5x based on tier |
| **Distribution** | Fixed per activity | Proportional to weighted BP |
| **Qualification** | Complex (4 requirements) | Simpler (starter kit purchase) |
| **Pool Source** | Various revenue sources | 30% of starter kit sales |

### 16.3 Migration Strategy

**Option 1: Dual System (Recommended)**
- Keep V1.0 running for existing Premium members
- Launch V2.0 for new members and new tiers
- Gradually migrate Premium members to Growth Plus (V2.0)
- Phase out V1.0 after 6 months

**Option 2: Hard Cutover**
- Convert all Premium members to Growth Plus
- Migrate existing cycles to new structure
- Higher risk, faster implementation

**Option 3: Hybrid Approach**
- Enhance V1.0 to support 4 tiers
- Keep fixed K25/day for simplicity
- Add tier multipliers to existing system
- Lower risk, less change

**Recommendation:** Option 1 (Dual System) for safety and flexibility

- Never expire, accumulate forever
- Determine professional level advancement
- Required: 0 → 500 → 1,500 → 4,000 → 10,000 → 25,000 → 50,000

**Bonus Points (BP) / Monthly Activity Points (MAP):**
- Reset to 0 on 1st of each month
- Determine share of 60% monthly profit pool
- Formula: `Member Bonus = (Member BP / Total BP) × 60% of Profit`

### Key Earning Activities

## 8. ChatGPT Prompt

**Copy this to ChatGPT:**

```
I need you to redesign the Starter Kits and MLM Reward System for MyGrowNet.

CURRENT SYSTEM:
- Starter Kits: 2 tiers (Basic K500, Premium K1,000)
- MLM Commissions: 7 levels paying 15%→10%→8%→6%→4%→3%→2% = 48% total
- Points: LP (never expire) + BP (reset monthly)
- Issues: Only 2 tiers, high payout (48%), harsh gating, complex requirements

REDESIGN TO:
1. Starter Kits: 3-5 tiers (K300-K2,000 range) with clear differentiation
2. MLM Commissions: Reduce to 35-40% total, add performance tiers
3. Points: Simplify earning, reduce monthly requirements, add retention
4. Maintain: 7-level structure, legal compliance, wallet integration

DELIVERABLES:
1. Starter Kit Structure (tiers, pricing, benefits, LGR multipliers, upgrades)
2. MLM Commission Structure (7-level rates totaling 35-40%, performance bonuses, gating rules)
3. Points System (simplified LP/BP earning, reduced requirements, retention mechanisms)
4. Implementation Notes (migration, database changes, business rules)

CONSTRAINTS:
- Total commission: 35-40% max (currently 48%)
- Starter kit range: K300-K2,000
- Must keep 7-level structure
- Must be sustainable and legally compliant
- Focus on product sales, not just recruitment

Please provide comprehensive redesign with clear value propositions, examples, and implementation guidance.
```

            // 4. Calculate LGR share
            $lgrAmount = $this->calculateLgrShare($weightedBp);
            
            // 5. Apply daily cap
            $lgrAmount = min($lgrAmount, $this->getDailyCap($user->lgr_tier));
            
            // 6. Credit as BP
            $this->awardLgr($user, $lgrAmount);

    foreach ($uplineReferrers as $referrerData) {
        $referrer = User::find($referrerData['user_id']);
        $level = $referrerData['level'];
        
        // Check starter kit status
        $commissionMultiplier = $referrer->has_starter_kit ? 1.0 : 0.5;
        
        // Calculate commission on 50% base
        $commissionRate = ReferralCommission::getCommissionRate($level);
        $commissionAmount = $commissionBase * ($commissionRate / 100) * $commissionMultiplier;
        
        // Create commission record
        ReferralCommission::create([
