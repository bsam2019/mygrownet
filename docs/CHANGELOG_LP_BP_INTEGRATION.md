# Changelog: LP/BP System Integration

**Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Version:** 3.0  
**Type:** Major Update

---

## Summary

Integrated the **Life Points (LP)** and **Bonus Points (BP)** dual-point reward system into the MyGrowNet platform documentation, enhancing the previous MAP (Monthly Activity Points) terminology with clearer, more descriptive names and adding comprehensive product ecosystem documentation.

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: This is a DOCUMENTATION ENHANCEMENT ONLY - No breaking changes to existing code!**

The existing points system implementation remains fully functional. BP is simply a clearer name for MAP that better describes its purpose (calculating monthly bonuses). All database schemas, models, and functionality remain unchanged.
