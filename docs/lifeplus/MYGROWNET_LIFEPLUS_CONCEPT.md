## 1. Introduction

MyGrowNet Life+ is a mobile application designed to support the daily needs of a wide range of users, including youths, workers, parents, students, and entrepreneurs. The purpose of the app is to provide tools that help users manage money, tasks, goals, and personal growth, while also connecting them to opportunities in their local communities.

The app does not replace or conflict with the existing MyGrowNet apps such as Marketplace, BizBoost, Venture Builder, GrowFinance, or Training. Instead, it becomes a central daily-use application that complements the MyGrowNet ecosystem.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Many people face challenges in managing their daily activities, planning their finances, accessing community information, and finding small opportunities to earn income. There is also a lack of simple digital tools that can help users organise their lives and build productive habits.

Most apps in Zambia focus on business or entertainment, but few support personal organisation, family planning, and daily budgeting. MyGrowNet Life+ fills this gap.

---

## 3. Purpose of the App

The purpose of MyGrowNet Life+ is to provide a set of essential tools that people can use every day. By doing this, MyGrowNet increases engagement, strengthens the community, and creates a foundation that encourages users to explore other apps in the MyGrowNet hub.
