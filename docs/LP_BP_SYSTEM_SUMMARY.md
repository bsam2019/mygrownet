## Quick Overview

MyGrowNet uses a revolutionary **dual-point reward system** that gamifies participation, measures loyalty, and distributes bonuses fairly:

### Life Points (LP)
- **Purpose**: Long-term growth tracking and professional advancement
- **Persistence**: Never expire, accumulate forever
- **Impact**: Determines your level (Associate → Ambassador)

### Bonus Points (BP)
- **Purpose**: Monthly earnings calculation
- **Persistence**: Reset monthly (1st of each month)
- **Impact**: Determines your share of the 60% profit pool

---

## How It Works in 3 Simple Steps

### Step 1: Earn Points Through Activities
Every action you take earns both LP and BP:
- Refer a member: **150 LP + 150 BP**
- Complete a course: **30-100 LP + 30-100 BP**
- Make a purchase: **10 LP + 10 BP per K100**
- Daily login: **0 LP + 5 BP**
- Monthly renewal: **25 LP + 25 BP**

### Step 2: LP Advances Your Level
Accumulate LP to climb the professional ladder:
- **Associate** (0 LP) → **Professional** (500 LP) → **Senior** (1,500 LP) → **Manager** (4,000 LP) → **Director** (10,000 LP) → **Executive** (25,000 LP) → **Ambassador** (50,000 LP)

Higher levels unlock:
- Enhanced multipliers
- Leadership benefits
- Greater profit-sharing weight
- Exclusive opportunities

### Step 3: BP Determines Monthly Bonus
At month-end, your BP share determines your earnings:

```
Your Bonus = (Your BP / Total BP) × 60% of Monthly Profit
```

**Example:**
- You earned: 300 BP
- Platform total: 50,000 BP
- Monthly profit: K100,000
- Bonus pool (60%): K60,000
- **Your bonus: (300/50,000) × K60,000 = K360**
