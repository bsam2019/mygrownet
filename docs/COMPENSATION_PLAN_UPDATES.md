# Compensation Plan Updates - October 24, 2025

## Summary of Changes

This document outlines all updates made to the MyGrowNet compensation plan to align with the new BP (Bonus Points) system and clarify the registration package structure.

## Important Clarifications

### Income Stream Distinction
1. **Monthly Bonus Pool (BP-Based):** Distribution based on BP share among active members
2. **Quarterly Profit-Sharing (Investment Projects):** 60% of investment project profits shared with ALL active members
   - Projects: Agriculture, manufacturing, real estate, services
   - Distribution: 50% equal share + 50% weighted by professional level
   - Separate from BP system

## Key Changes

### 1. Registration Package Structure
**Old System:**
- Registration: K500
- Welcome Bonus: 25 LP + 25 BP (K120 value)

**New System:**
- Registration: K500
- Welcome Package: **25 LP + K225 cash bonus** (Total value: K345)
- No BP awarded on registration

### 2. Referral Commission System
**Old System:**
- Commissions paid in cash
- Direct referral: K75 cash

**New System:**
- **All referral commissions converted to BP**
- Conversion rate: **K2 per BP**
- Level 1: K75 → **37.5 BP**
- Level 2: K50 → **25 BP**
- Level 3: K40 → **20 BP**
- Level 4: K30 → **15 BP**
- Level 5: K25 → **12.5 BP**
- Level 6: K15 → **7.5 BP**
- Level 7: K5 → **2.5 BP**

### 3. BP Purpose
- **BP accumulates for monthly bonus pool distribution**
- Formula: Your Bonus = (Your BP ÷ Total BP) × 60% of Company Profit
- BP resets monthly (fresh start each month)
- Rewards current activity and engagement

### 4. LP Purpose

- Determines professional level advancement

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New Member Registration
**Action:** John registers and pays K500

**John receives:**
- 25 LP (for level advancement)
- K225 cash bonus (immediate value)
- Total value: K345

**John's referrer (Sarah) receives:**
- 37.5 BP (from K75 commission at K2/BP)
- BP accumulates for monthly bonus pool

### Scenario 2: Building a Network
**Action:** Sarah builds a 3-level network

**Sarah's earnings:**
- Level 1 (3 direct): 3 × 37.5 BP = 112.5 BP
- Level 2 (9 indirect): 9 × 25 BP = 225 BP
- Level 3 (27 indirect): 27 × 20 BP = 540 BP
- **Total: 877.5 BP**

**Monthly bonus calculation:**
- Company profit: K100,000
- Bonus pool (60%): K60,000
- Total BP in system: 50,000 BP
- Sarah's share: (877.5 ÷ 50,000) × K60,000 = **K1,053**

### Scenario 3: Full Network (7 Levels)
**Action:** Sarah fills all 3,279 positions

**Sarah's potential:**
- Total BP: 60,000 BP (from K120,000 cash value)
- If she has 10% of total BP in system
- Monthly bonus: 10% × K60,000 = **K6,000/month**
- Plus other income streams (product sales, profit-sharing, etc.)
