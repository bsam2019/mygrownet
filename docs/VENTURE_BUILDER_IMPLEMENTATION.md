# Venture Builder - Implementation Plan

**Last Updated:** October 30, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Phase 1, 2 & 3 Complete - Core Features Ready

---

## Overview

The Venture Builder feature enables MyGrowNet members to co-invest in vetted business projects and become legal shareholders in newly formed companies. This document outlines the technical implementation approach.

### Legal Structure & Regulatory Compliance

**MyGrowNet's Role:**
- **Facilitator/Platform** - NOT an investment fund or collective investment scheme
- **Business Incubator** - Conducts market research, business planning, and due diligence
- **Matchmaker** - Connects vetted business opportunities with potential co-investors
- **Minority Co-investor** - Takes 20-40% equity stake in each formed company

**How It Works:**
1. MyGrowNet vets and prepares business opportunity
2. Lists opportunity on platform for member co-investment
3. Members invest directly into the specific business (NOT into MyGrowNet)
4. When funding target reached → **New separate company is registered**
5. Each funded venture becomes an independent legal entity (e.g., "ABC Farms Ltd")
6. Shares allocated proportionally:
   - MyGrowNet: 20-40% (for facilitation and ongoing support)
   - Investors: 60-80% (proportional to investment amounts)
7. Company operates independently with proper governance
8. Dividends paid by the NEW company (not MyGrowNet)

**Why This Avoids BOZ/SEC Regulation:**
- ❌ NOT pooling funds for MyGrowNet to manage
- ❌ NOT promising returns from MyGrowNet's operations
- ✅ Each venture = separate independent business entity
- ✅ Direct shareholding in operating companies
- ✅ MyGrowNet = platform facilitator + minority co-investor
- ✅ Proper company registration and governance for each venture

**Key Distinction:**
Members are NOT investing in MyGrowNet. They are co-investing in specific business ventures that will become separate legal entities. MyGrowNet facilitates the process and participates as a minority shareholder.

## Legal & Compliance Framework

### Regulatory Compliance Strategy

**Avoiding Investment Fund Regulations:**
- Platform operates as business facilitator, NOT investment manager
- No pooled investment fund managed by MyGrowNet
- Each venture = separate legal entity with independent governance
- MyGrowNet participates as minority shareholder (20-40%)
- Direct shareholding model (not unit trusts or collective schemes)

**Company Formation Process:**
1. **Funding Phase** - Investments held in escrow/trust account
2. **Target Reached** - Trigger company registration process
3. **New Company Registered** - Independent legal entity formed
4. **Share Allocation** - Proportional to investment amounts
5. **Governance Setup** - Board of directors, shareholder agreements
6. **MyGrowNet Role** - Minority shareholder + ongoing support

**Shareholder Rights:**
- Legal ownership in registered company
- Voting rights at AGMs
- Dividend entitlements
- Access to company financial reports
- Exit mechanisms (share transfer/buyback)

**MyGrowNet's Equity Stake:**
- 20-40% shareholding in each venture
- Compensation for:
  - Market research and business planning
  - Due diligence and vetting
  - Platform facilitation
  - Ongoing business support
  - Administrative services

### Documentation Requirements

**Per Venture:**
- Business plan and financial projections
- Shareholder agreement template
- Company registration documents
- Memorandum and Articles of Association
- Share certificates
- Dividend policy
- Exit strategy documentation

**Platform Level:**
- Terms of service (facilitation, not investment advice)
- Risk disclosures
- Platform usage agreements
- Privacy policy
- KYC/AML procedures

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive financial data
- Secure document storage
- Audit logging for all transactions
- Role-based access control

### Compliance
- KYC verification for co-investors
- Transaction limits and monitoring
- Proper company registration for each venture
- Legal document management
- Shareholder registry maintenance

This can be customized per venture in future iterations.
