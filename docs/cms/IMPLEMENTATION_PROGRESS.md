## Technical Decisions Made

### Database Design
- **Decimal(15,2)** for all monetary values (supports up to 999,999,999,999.99)
- **JSON columns** for flexible settings and permissions
- **Enum types** for status fields (better than string comparison)
- **Composite indexes** for multi-column queries
- **Unique constraints** scoped by company_id

### Naming Conventions
- **Tables:** `cms_` prefix for all CMS tables
- **Foreign Keys:** `{table}_id` format
- **Indexes:** `idx_` prefix with descriptive names
- **Unique Constraints:** `unique_` prefix with descriptive names

### Architecture Decisions
- **Domain-Driven Design:** Clear separation of concerns
- **Event-Driven:** Prepared for event listeners
- **Multi-Tenant:** Company-scoped data isolation
- **Audit Trail:** Complete change tracking from day one
