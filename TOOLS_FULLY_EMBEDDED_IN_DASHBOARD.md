# Embedding Full Tools in Mobile Dashboard

## What Needs to Be Done

Instead of just showing previews with links, I need to embed the ACTUAL WORKING TOOLS directly in the mobile dashboard:

### 1. Earnings Calculator (Full)
- All earning type selectors
- All input fields
- Real-time calculations
- Results display
- Everything functional within dashboard

### 2. Goal Tracker (Full)
- Create goal form
- Active goals list with progress bars
- Update progress functionality
- Completed goals display
- Everything functional within dashboard

### 3. Network Visualizer (Full)
- Network stats cards
- Level breakdown
- Network tree with expand/collapse
- Member details
- Everything functional within dashboard

## Implementation Approach

1. Copy the logic from the standalone tool pages
2. Adapt the layout for mobile dashboard
3. Make it compact but fully functional
4. Keep all interactivity
5. No external navigation needed

Let me implement this properly now...
