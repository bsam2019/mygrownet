## Problem & Solution

### The Problem
- Informal economy lacks structured platforms
- Opportunities circulate through unreliable word-of-mouth

### The Solution
A simple platform where:
- Anyone can post needs/offers via voice
- Local matching happens automatically
- Trust builds through completed interactions
- No formal credentials required

## Core Features

### 1. Dual Intent System

This creates equality (no "provider" vs "client" hierarchy).

- Record voice posts (auto-transcribed)
- Listen to offers (text-to-speech)
- Voice feedback and reviews
- Works for all literacy levels

### 3. Location-Based Matching
- Automatic location detection
- Radius-based discovery
- Distance sorting
- Nearby notifications

### 4. Community Trust System
Instead of star ratings:
- Completion count
- Repeat engagements
- Voice testimonials
- Response time
- Reliability score

### 5. Simple Categories
Icon-based navigation:
- 🔨 Construction & Repairs
- 🧹 Cleaning & Domestic
- 🚗 Transportation
- 👶 Childcare
- 🌾 Agriculture & Trade
- 🤝 Community Tasks
