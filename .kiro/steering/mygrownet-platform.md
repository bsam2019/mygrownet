### Profit Distribution Structure
- **60% of project profits** distributed to active members
- **40%** retained for operations, growth, and reserves
- Distribution occurs **quarterly**
- Weighted by professional level (higher levels receive larger shares)

### Eligibility
- **Active Member** = Current subscription paid + platform engagement
- All levels qualify (Associate through Ambassador)
- Profit share proportional to level and tenure

### Example Projects
- Agricultural ventures
- Manufacturing businesses
- Service companies
- Real estate investments
- Community enterprises with profit-sharing

## Profit-Sharing Model

MyGrowNet invests in community projects (agriculture, manufacturing, services, etc.) and shares profits with all active members:

**Distribution Structure:**
- **60% of project profits** distributed to active members
- **40%** retained for operations, growth, and reserves

**Quarterly Distribution:**
- **50% equal share** - All active members receive equal portion
- **50% weighted share** - Based on professional level (Ambassador receives more than Associate)

**Active Member Criteria:**
- Current subscription paid
- Logged in within last 30 days
- Participating in platform activities

**Example:** If a project generates K100,000 profit:
- K60,000 goes to members
- K30,000 distributed equally among all active members
- K30,000 distributed proportionally by professional level

## Points System

MyGrowNet uses a dual-points system to drive engagement and ensure active participation:

### Lifetime Points (LP)
- **Purpose**: Professional level advancement (Associate → Ambassador)
- **Persistence**: Never expire, accumulate forever
- **Usage**: Determines professional level and long-term status

### Monthly Activity Points (MAP)
- **Purpose**: Qualify for monthly commissions, bonuses, and profit-sharing
- **Persistence**: Reset to 0 on the 1st of each month
- **Usage**: Members must earn minimum MAP to receive earnings

### Key Features
- **Multiple earning paths**: Network building, product sales, education, community engagement
- **Streak multipliers**: 3+ consecutive active months = 1.1x to 1.5x point multipliers
- **Performance tiers**: Bronze/Silver/Gold/Platinum based on monthly MAP (up to +30% commission bonus)
- **Team synergy bonus**: Extra points when entire first level qualifies
- **Gamification**: Badges, achievements, leaderboards, monthly challenges

### Monthly Qualification Requirements

- Professional: 200 MAP
- Senior: 300 MAP
