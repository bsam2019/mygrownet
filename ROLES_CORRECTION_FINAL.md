# Roles System - Final Correction

## Critical Clarification

The 7 professional levels (Associate, Professional, Senior, Manager, Director, Executive, Ambassador) are **NOT roles** - they are **progression levels**.

---

## ✅ Correct System Roles

### Only 2 Main Roles:

1. **admin** - Platform administrators
   - Full system access
   - Manage all platform features

2. **member** - Regular platform users
   - Subscribe to packages
   - Access learning materials
   - Participate in network
   - Earn commissions

### Plus 1 Legacy Role:

3. **investor** - Legacy (same as member)
   - Kept for backward compatibility
   - New users should use 'member'

---

## ✅ Professional Levels (NOT Roles)

**Stored in**: `users.professional_level` (integer 1-7)

| Level | Name | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| 1 | Associate | New member |
| 2 | Professional | Skilled member |
| 3 | Senior | Experienced member |
| 4 | Manager | Team leader |
| 5 | Director | Strategic leader |
| 6 | Executive | Top performer |
| 7 | Ambassador | Brand representative |

**Used for**:
- Commission rate calculation
- Monthly MAP requirements
- Benefit eligibility
- Progression tracking

**NOT used for**:
- Access control
- Permissions
- Middleware
- Guards

## How to Use

### Check Access (Use Role)

```php
// Check if user can access admin features
if ($user->hasRole('admin')) {
    // Allow access
}

// Check if user is a member
if ($user->hasRole('member')) {
    // Show member dashboard
}
```

### Check Progression (Use Level)

```php
// Get commission rate based on level
$rate = match($user->professional_level) {
    1 => 15%, // Associate
    2 => 10%, // Professional
    3 => 8%,  // Senior
    4 => 6%,  // Manager
    5 => 4%,  // Director
    6 => 3%,  // Executive
    7 => 2%,  // Ambassador
};

// Check MAP requirement
$requiredMap = match($user->professional_level) {
    1 => 100,  // Associate
    2 => 200,  // Professional
    3 => 300,  // Senior
    4 => 400,  // Manager
    5 => 500,  // Director
    6 => 600,  // Executive
    7 => 800,  // Ambassador
};
```

## Database Structure

### Roles (Access Control)
```
roles table:
- admin
- member
- investor (legacy)
```

### Professional Levels (Progression)
```
users table:
- professional_level (1-7)
  1 = Associate
  2 = Professional
  3 = Senior
  4 = Manager
  5 = Director
  6 = Executive
  7 = Ambassador
```

---

## Seeder Output

When you run `php artisan db:seed --class=RoleSeeder`, you'll see:

```
✅ System Roles (Access Control):
  • admin - Platform administrators
  • member - Regular platform users

⚠️  Legacy Roles (Backward Compatibility):
  • investor - Use "member" instead

IMPORTANT: Professional Levels (Associate, Professional, Senior, Manager, Director, Executive, Ambassador)
are NOT roles! They are progression levels stored in users.professional_level (1-7).
```

---

## Key Points

1. **Only 2 main roles**: admin, member
2. **7 professional levels**: 1-7 (Associate → Ambassador)
3. **Roles** = Access control
4. **Levels** = Progression tracking
5. **Never confuse the two!**
