# Ubumi - Family Lineage & Health Check-In Platform

**Last Updated:** January 21, 2026  
**Status:** Concept Phase  
**Target Market:** Zambia (Pilot)  
**Platform Type:** Mobile-First Web Application

## Overview

Ubumi (meaning "life" in local languages) is a family-centric digital platform that enables Zambian families to:

- Document and maintain their family tree digitally
- Stay informed about the wellbeing of family members
- Receive alerts when a member may need support
- Strengthen family bonds across geographic distances

**Important:** Ubumi is NOT a medical system. It is a family communication and wellness awareness tool designed to strengthen care, accountability, and continuity within families.

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges in Zambia

1. **Geographic Dispersion**: Families are spread across urban and rural areas, making regular check-ins difficult
2. **No Digital Lineage**: No simple, trusted way to track family lineage digitally
3. **Informal Health Awareness**: Health tracking within families is informal and often reactive
4. **Vulnerable Members**: Elderly and vulnerable family members may go long periods without follow-up
5. **System Gaps**: Existing health systems do not provide family-level visibility

### Impact

Illness, emergencies, or deaths are often discovered late, increasing emotional, financial, and social costs to families.

## Target Users

### Primary Users
- Adults (18–45) responsible for family coordination
- Urban and peri-urban smartphone users
- Family heads and caregivers

### Secondary Users
- Elderly family members (assisted usage)
- Rural family members (low-data mode)
- Extended family members

### Future Stakeholders
- Community health workers
- Faith-based organizations
- NGOs and social programs
- Government health initiatives

---

## Core Objectives

1. **Preserve Family Lineage**: Create a trusted digital record of family relationships
2. **Enable Wellness Check-Ins**: Simple, dignified way for family members to share their status
3. **Improve Responsiveness**: Help families respond quickly to health needs
4. **Build Trust**: Create a family-centric digital space that respects privacy and culture
5. **Enable Integration**: Lay groundwork for future institutional partnerships
