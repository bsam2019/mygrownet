**Date:** November 23, 2025  
**Purpose:** Help determine appropriate valuation for investment rounds

## What is Valuation?

Valuation is what you believe your company is worth. It determines how much equity you give away for the investment.

**Formula:**
```
Equity % = Investment Amount / Post-Money Valuation
```

**Example:**
- Investment: K500,000
- Pre-Money Valuation: K2,000,000
- Post-Money Valuation: K2,500,000
- Equity Given: 500,000 / 2,500,000 = 20%

---

## Valuation Methods

### 1. Revenue Multiple Method
**Formula:** `Valuation = Annual Revenue × Multiple`

**SaaS/Subscription Multiples:**
- Early stage (< K1M revenue): 3-5x
- Growth stage (K1M-K10M): 5-10x
- Mature (> K10M): 10-15x

**Example:**
- Annual Revenue: K500,000
- Multiple: 5x
- Valuation: K2,500,000

### 2. Comparable Companies
Look at similar companies in Zambia/Africa:
- Community platforms
- Subscription services
- EdTech platforms
- Network marketing platforms

**Adjust for:**
- Your growth rate (faster = higher)
- Your market size
- Your profitability
- Your technology/IP

### 3. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)
Project future cash flows and discount to present value.

**Steps:**
1. Project 5-year revenue
2. Estimate profit margins
3. Calculate free cash flow
4. Discount at 20-30% (risk rate)
5. Sum discounted values

### 4. Venture Capital Method
**Formula:** `Valuation = Exit Value / Expected Return`

**Example:**
- Expected exit in 5 years: K25M
- Investor wants 10x return
- Current valuation: K25M / 10 = K2.5M

## How to Calculate Your Valuation

### Step 1: Calculate Annual Revenue
```
Monthly Revenue × 12 = Annual Revenue
```

### Step 2: Choose Your Multiple
Based on your stage and growth:
- High growth (>100% YoY): 8-10x
- Medium growth (50-100% YoY): 5-8x
- Steady growth (20-50% YoY): 3-5x

### Step 3: Calculate Base Valuation
```
Annual Revenue × Multiple = Base Valuation
```

### Step 4: Adjust for Factors
- Add 20-30% if you have strong network effects
- Add 10-20% if you have multiple revenue streams
- Add 10-20% if you have proprietary technology
- Subtract 20-30% if you're pre-revenue
- Subtract 10-20% if you have high churn

### Step 5: Sanity Check
- Does it make sense for your stage?
- Would investors get reasonable returns?
- Are you giving away too much equity?
